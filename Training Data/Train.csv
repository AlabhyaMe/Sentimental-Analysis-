1. There are no clear instructions for extending medical leave. I was told the Request for Medical Information was being mailed to me and has not arrived - 2 weeks now.   2. I have called for more than 2 weeks without getting through to EDD. I  sent emails and responses were either delayed or insufficient. I have contacted our Senator's office to help me.  3. My practitioner is out of state and I need to extend my leave but am still  left in the dark about how to do so.  4. The Request for Medical Information form that is supposed to come to me is not available on line.  5. None of the help tools help.,N
2 times i left messages and never received answer,O
"A bit confusing st first,  but after  using for some time it's very easy to navigate",P
A excellent process that helps you navigate the process,P
A little confused with checking in thru Edd then the application has to be saved the app for sdi and that part I didn't understand and kept filling over and over again,O
A little hard to navigate,N
"A lot of the time the website was down, the website is not easy to follow, getting ahold of a real person is almost impossible.",N
A surprisingly easy website to navigate,P
Ability to reach representatives at EDD is the worst!,N
"Account locked.  Don't know security question answer.  Can't reset password.  EDD says they don't recognize my phone number.  No one available to answer phone for over 5 days now.  Local EDD, One Stop, only has 1 person 1 day a week that knows anything about EDD.",N
After a coworker advised me of the benefit I found the online process to be fairly simple.,O
"After an hour of wait, I was grateful I got a hold of a staff. The staff says there is a 30 day delay for my disability claim and I am still unsure if I will get the full 10 to 12 weeks. I did like that she clarified that I want to note that I want to get my SDI claim benefit [DATE] as specified by my doctor. I did like that she said she needed the time to contact my employer to tell them not to call me to work during this time and to confirm there are no benefits.",P
After having a stroke something this important was useful asking Edd chat did not answer questions,P
After logging in. It took me forever to find out where the one inbox message was. I had to keep going in and out until I finally found it. Very confusing for me.,N
"After missing a call from one of your representatives , I called the representative back three times and left messages. No one has returned my call.  My job is [OCCUPATION], so I'm often driving and unable to communicate safely on the phone. Your recent emails didn't provide me any additional guidance.",N
"After my almost years attempt to have my missing wages added and countless calls with never getting through I had to contact my state representative to assist with the approval and also to have my missing wages added. Never once have been able to speak to a live representative because the lines are too busy. Local office line and wait time is always over 2 hours, and parking at the local office is not available for use, is the claimant's are required to pay up to $15 a day to attempt to resolve or seek assistance from the local [CITY] office.",N
After the fact questions and updates  and the filling out process is some what unclear if there's a update with doctor should there be another claim submitted or not regrading time off or not,N
"Again, terrible website. I'm pretty well versed with a complete so I can only imagine how much more challenging this situation is for those who are not.",N
All avenues point to a phone number that always is over loaded. I did use the work order system to ultimately get my account accessible but by the time I was able to do that between ICU stay I was denied disability and eventually was put in contact with a resource over the phone who was incredibly helpful,O
All info is there just learning where to find it,O
All is good but to contact the disability insurance by phone   It is the very worst experience that anyone could have,N
"All on line, useful.",P
All perfect.... customer service all perfect,P
all the  buttons are not clear,O
All the information provided does not actually help because the system is so slow. Getting a response takes weeks so little is automated that the website is useless if you are trying to find out why a claim is not being processed.,N
All the process Is clear.,P
"All the websites were very helpful, without them I would have had no information on how to proceed with the process.",P
All too often the materials are difficult to understand,N
All useful.,P
"Although there is information in the faqs, it is hardly helpful due to this poorly designed system for correspondents.",N
Always unable to speak with anyone to help me,P
answer the phone,O
Answered my questions perfectly,P
Answered questions I was looking for.,P
answers many question and also helped with concerns and education,P
Anyone applying for disability should have an interview first to clarify that there are two types of disabilities... State disability and EDD disability.  Or have to take a video class and pass it.  It is very confusing.  Having to have a dedicated e-mail just for your communications is difficult because I hope I can find a part time job that I can keep - it's not on my mind that I need to check this e-mail.  I am super upset at the process.,N
"Applying for disability was one of the most confusing things. It took me forever to find the information on when to apply for pregnancy disability and even then it wasn't completely clear what I needed to do and what date to put for disability start date. It also feels unnecessarily complicated. And calling is useless since the phone lines are always so busy that it will automatically hang up. So it feels like there is no way to get questions answered unless it's something in FAQs or that the AI chat can answer, which typically it isn't.",N
"As a person disabled from working and seeking answers to avoid hardship, it was Very hard contacting someone.  Ask EDD, wasn't helpful. This triggers anxiety, depression and angry being stuck in limbo.  If EDD can have different lines for different departments, it would cut down the stree on employees and customers.  Being on disability isn't easy especially since a person is losing their livihood.  Thousands of Californians are out of work due to injury/illness, this process to get answer would be stress added to their current situation.   I would mention, once a customer finally reaches an EDD agent, the process is amazing but the conversations are always intense due to the prior process..",N
As good as can be expected for a government website,P
"Ask edd did not provide answers to specific questions, it was more of a general FAQ set up.",O
Asked were I can see all my past bonding dates or claims and all that comes up is my pending not the past ones. Should be able to see pending and past claims for bonding not just the pending and disability claims only.,O
"At first glance, some what difficult to navigate through. Visiting the [CITY] office, I was able to get a better understanding by talking with a representative.",P
At first it was overwhelming but the more I read the easier it got,P
Automated system does not comprehend request to speak to a human. This survey has a delay and is not responding correctly. You need someone that actually knows how resolve I T issues,O
awesome experience. very useful,P
"Bad customer service on ATM card, hard to use, pls have your systems compatible to I phones , i don't have computer at home",N
Basically it was just a text or chat,O
"Because I had added my middle name to my license, my name wasn't registering in the system and I had to go to the office to correct it",O
Before it was a little confusing to do everything.  But I think now is more clear and  I understand everything,P
Better status update section. With update statuses that make sense and give days of how long things will take or if any information is still needed.,O
"Bueno el sistema me pide que agá una cuenta pero el acceso es denegado [Well, the system asks me to open an account but access is denied]",O
"By far the worst in this state. You all need to be fired and ashamed of the job you do. Simply, its ridiculous.",N
By using the various subheadings gave me a better insight on what am looking for or need in terms of claim clarity.,P
Call about 6 times and finally talked to someone and that was confusing. Then she said I would get a form in the mail and I never did  I kept trying to call back for 5 days getting a recording.,N
Call me and I'll tell you so much that is wrong with your website and call center,N
Called many times and will say maximum calls already reached at 8:01am.,N
Called the first time for 6 days. Alway saying not available,N
Calling by phone is absolutely ridiculous! The EDD should be ashamed!!!,N
Calling EDD was difficult. The employees do not answer. I visited 2 offices and was given different answers. My claim took 4 month. I did not receive payment putting my family in financial strain!,N
"Calling in to speak to someone is a nuisance. Any background noise messes up the call, entering information on the phone, the automated system does not understand, and no availability of representatives every time I call.",N
Calling takes a long time to wait.  But it is always helpful speaking to the agent.,O
Calls are hardly answeted at 8 am tul 1200.i was calling  just hoping to get a person i just made a call at 0800 it s already voicenail saying the max call for today has reached  maximum to yry again .

Cannot log in. Went to the office 2 time they were full for the day at 1 pm. Tried calling at 8 am twice they were full before 8:01. Horrible experience. Not getting paid I have been off of work s1.5 months.,N
"Can't access forms through my phone, impossible to reach a person, questions just keep putting you back in the useless loop when trying to use online help",N
"Can't claimed SDI employment information, indicate the last day of working and the beginnings of disability dates and the websites keep rejecting it keep showing an error   The sad part is it very hard to talk to representatives, the phone is ringing and then the machine answer and it said phone line has reach maximum calling then hang up.",N
"Can't every get thru on phone! Had to pay $15 to park total drive and office visit([STREET ADDRESS],[CITY]) three Hours. Maybe ten minutes at window, 2-1/2 hour in line for only 3- windows.

cómo le aga para poder apelar mi solicitud de incapacidad [How do I help you to be able to appeal my disability application],O
Constantly being bounced around from call this number to email this address all for it to refer you back to a source that you previously used to get information only to be told to use another source that doesn't give what's needed.,N
Contact is beyond terrible!!!!!,N
Contact with Di by message limited. By ph. Almost impossible.   Time spent waiting for a reply not very positive with no income.,N
Contacting used several times and never received response I still haven't received my disability payments in full and it has been 6 weeks.,N
Could not contact anyone at EDD by phone or by email. Had to physically go to office when I got back to work because my claim was on hold and no responses to email. The worst government agency I have delt with by far.,N
Could not download form DE2593 or even find it.,O
Could not get through on the phone.    Someone called me on the phone.,O
"Could not locate forms, my benefits were suspended 4 weeks with no notification. I called as directed for 2 weeks and could never reach anyone",N
Could not speak to a representative   Could not find out answer to security question,O
"Couldn't find answers online to many questions, chat wasn't working, calling took a few tries",N
Couldn't get in contact with a representative on the phone. Called several times over several days but it kept saying the maximum amount on hold has been reached and then it would hang up on me.,N
"d Make it easier to update...too generalize and more options to be specific,.",O
Despite being able to login I continually received an Error E311. Ask EDD email which had me submit and resubmit info inevitably telling me to submit hard forms via mail instead of helping address the root issue and/or providing my receipt #. I am 4 weeks in with no pay and now received a new packet with that receipt # and the root issue in resolved.,O
Didn't have any of the answers I was looking for. I got my DE429D form which was wildly incorrect and said to contact EDD immediately if the information was wrong. It's nearly impossible to actually contact EDD.,N
Difficult getting questions answered. Would prefer speaking with a live person. Kept getting sent in circles for the same thing!,O
"Difficult process, Trying to apply as a claimant and get it to connect with ID.ME and it is not doing it. Error E324 keeps popping up, but I guess this is peak govt efficiency. Keep giving people the runaround so you dont actually have to do any work. Instead try hiring actual Web developers to fix your broken website",N
Difficult to communicate with. Extremely frustrating a website is not helpful,N
"Difficult to navigate, cannot get to talk to a real person when needed.",N

EDD and SDI are horribly inefficient and despite 100s of calls I can NEVER her through to a human to ask why my claim was Pending for more than 2 months before I got just one payment then received emails that my supplemental 60 days leave authorized by my doctor is being disqualified. I've received no letters in the mail. I've tried to appeal online with no response. I've asked many times for claim updates with no response. This state run entity is AWFUL you should all be fired!,N
Edd has not responded to my request since [DATE],O
"EDD is impossible to get hold of on the phone. I have used the online contact and no one ever responds. When calling, after listening to a recording saying how busy they are they hang up on you. When you are disabled and need to pay your bills till you can get back to work, it's scary when money is late and no one will answer the phone or return your emails.  Also why do we have to miss a full week of pay?  That causes an extreme hardship for those of us living paycheck to paycheck.",N
EDD is the most elusive and the MOST MOST MOST HORRIBLE TO THING TO HELP WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY DOWN!!!  EDD is like such the worst EVIL FORCE in our government!!!,N
EDD needs improvement in the [CITY] office. We as applicants have to wait long lines and when you finally get to speak to someone they rush or do not know the answers to your questions.,O
EDD never answers their phone or responds to online inquiries,N
edd responded very fast,P
"EDD website had system issues, because of that I had a hard time to submit claim. EDD customer service call was always busy and never been connected. EDD should have more helpful services",N
EDD Website is hardly useful on anything one needs to know about the agency. All you need is to follow the step by step instructions.,N
Edd website NOT user friendly,N
Edd website was very helpful.,P
"Edd.ca.gov is the worse system for online or call, I became disable on [DATE], I called and called and called, no been able to get an answered, 8:00 am no available yet, continued dialing all representatives are busy  kept trying, to not avail. finally I was able to get an email in my EDD inbox, asking me to call, again the same issue, not one available, it does not matter what time it is.  the ID,me is a joke, after so many times I was able to speak to someone that looks that he had just got out of bed. I have to ask more questions in order to finished the registration, if it wasn't, because I asked questions, I could have never finished with his information. They need to have people that is well train and want to work,  Here I am over a month since I became disable, and not been able to speak to anyone to give them the info they requested, I call to speak to someone, not one available.  How I am going to pay my bills or rent?? EDD.ca.gov is the WORSE",N

"Even though my Edd shows my payment schedule, I still have not received payment.",O
"Every ask edd question I submitted was ignored. I am told one thing by an edd employee, yet the website doesn't have the option they suggested.  How come there isnt any sharing of information between DI and UI?  The edd associate told me I have to certify for disability benefits when I was on automatic payments?  a lot of misinformation going around and no real answers arr given.",N
Every call ends up already being they're too full call again later,N
Every question was forwarded to the same phone number. After 5 days of no answer and the message that all agents wert busy followed by a hangup!! I decided to travel to Sacramento to talk to a human.,N
Every time I call I'm informed that the que is full and am hung up on. I submitted a question online through ask edd and am not getting a timely answer.,N
"Every time I logged in, I kept receiving error messages. It took four days for me to apply for Disability Insurance.",N
Every time I need help or try to call I can never speak to anyone very disappointing,N
Every time I tried to to someone all I got was an automated system with no results.It very difficult to to to anyone in EDD.,N
"Every time I try to use your website, it boots me out, and I have to read login, I have been trying to call for an hour and I keep getting told there's no one available and the system just keeps hanging up on me.",N
"Everyone I talked to say the same thing it takes to long to get the money that as working citizens pay into, also the continuation of benefits is not as easy to fill out and because it's filled out wrong of the getting the benefits takes a long time, and if the claimant doesn't contact the EDD office they don't contact you to fix the problem.",N
"Everything about navigating the EDD system is overwhelming, especially when you are dealing with a crisis that requires navigating the EDD system. I am truly fortunate that I have a relative that needed to apply for SDI when he was involuntarily retired from his job. Otherwise I would have NEVER been able to complete the mountain of paperwork required to get these benefits. I have no idea how most people in need do this without a close friend or relative that has the time and inclination to help. I must say that the system around getting EDD benefits is broken. It needs to MUCH more user-friendly to be of help to the vast majority of people that need it the most.",N

Filed with the help of a social worker which made the entire process very understanding,P
Filing for disability was quick and easy. Especially since I didn't have to find or calculate my past hours of employment,P
Filing for new claims seems to have a lot of explanation but is not very used friendly.  Overly complicated,N
"First and foremost, I have to create an account in order to login. When you login, make sure you follow the instructions.",O
First of I called over 300 times could get help one time I got lady hund up me first I'm just started dialysis she was very rude,N
"First off, people want to talk to people.  So, having more staff to answer the phones would bring happiness to a lot of folks who are already stressed due to their disability.  And, if my call can't be answered, I'd like to know immediately instead of learning it a couple of minutes later.     The Contact Us and FAQ section requires too much reading and searching and becomes frustrating.  It's too difficult to provide examples in writing and without the pages in front of me.",N
"Fixed my mistakes, removed my confusion.",O
For 2 weeks the telephone contact says there are no representatives to help. And you cannot use the call back features. The FAQs not helpful,N
For me it is a very complicated system and it does not solve the problem.,N
Form i need to fill out never came,O
Forms and info seemed easy enough,P
Forms are conveniently uploaded for user's use. Thank you.,P
Forms showed up late. When navigating out of a page I was logged out by the system almost every time and had to login and navigate all over again not knowing what section to use.,N
Found all the information to be very useful,P
Found most info  I was looking for,P
Getting someone to answer the phone is difficult.,N
"Getting through to EDD is impossible, needing a better system. Online is not always helpful and can get very frustrating. It took me longer to submit my claim because I had no assistance.  Customer service assistance needs to get better. It says payment should post within 14 days and my second payment has not posted to my account. I'm confused!!!!!!!",N
Getting through to EDD on the phone or via email is useless. I had to drive 20 miles to the nearest EDD office to get any help whatsoever. Very poor communication resources .,N
Gives you details how to fill it out,O
Good,P
"Got a lot of error messages. It said to contact disability office but tried calling many times throughout the day, for several days, and was not able to get a hold a anyone. Kept being told no reps available and told to call back. Very, very frustrating trying to file a claim or to talk to a rep and not being successful at all. As of today, I still can't file a claim to get through to a rep. Changes need to be made to this program and make it easier to file a claim. Make representatives available to talk to us and help us out with the process or when errors in filing occur. Make it a less stressful and frustrating process. Answer the phones please!",N
Got some of the info needed,P
Great,P
Great help with question when I eventually spoke with you. Very hard to get a live call though. Left question on the site and a few days later did get the response that I was looking for,P

Had a hard time actually getting to talk to a rep directly,N
"Had a hard time with filing. I had an EDD account during covid, the site wanted me to sign in with my password which I had forgotten. So I chose to reset my password in doing that the site asked for the last amount of my check that was issued to me for my Covid pay. I had no idea how much that was since it was four years ago. Also, it was deposited onto a Bank of America card, which is now closed so I had no way to know what that amount was. after that, I could not change my password without knowing that amount so I had to call and of course I could not get through because it's always busy so finally I got through on like a week later. I talked to  a person asked them if I could file with them they said no, asked them if I could have them change my password, they said no. They then gave me a phone number to change my password. This took entirely too long to accomplish. I called that number they changed my password, which was helped. But the had a hard time with the Id.me site.",N
Had all the answers for questions I had.,P
"Had difficulty using the options I was given. I called the 800 number that's shown for help, but I never spoke to anyone. I kept getting a call back later message because lines were busy, I did call back numerous times with same message's and didn't receive help.",N

Hard to  Connect with someone live,N
Hard to contact anybody from EDD. Due to answering machine. not like before when you call they answered right away.,N
Hard to find and navigate,N
"Hard to get ahold of anyone for help. My whole case was messed up, the lady I finally got through too after three weeks of calling at least 15 times a day staying on hold until it hung up on me, was very nice and she helped me very quickly. I wish I could remember her name because she was great and got my stuff together within a matter of minutes. It is very hard to get ahold of people when you need help. There are people who have families and are on the verge of losing their homes and need this money, there should be better ways to be able to get ahold of someone.",N
Hard to get in touch with EDD's customer service. I want to know why my benefits was stopped. I went on line to see what's going on and saw that there was a form that I needed to fill out but the problem is i didn't see the email in time for me to be able to reach the deadline. But I saw there that my dr turned in my extension certificate. Now I am left with 1 benefit payment not paid and wondering if my benefit payment will still continue. I have one month to go for disability so that's 3 benefit payment that I might not get. Need those to pay my bills. I am behind with my bills right now. EDD should make it easier for us to reach the customer service and find out what's going on. Just today I've called EDD 8x already but I always end up 'customer service already reach maximum calls . Try calling again.' Same thing happened yesterday. This is so frustrating.,N
Hard to get some answers or figure out what you need. They don't get back to you.,N
"Hard to login and not helpful at the office ,  No one answers over the phone .",N
Hard to reach a customer rep thru the phone with caller limits reached. No possible way to get in contact with someone at any time. Call system makes it extremely difficult to reach your call destination in order to speak to a rep and by that time you receive a message that the caller amounts limits have been reached and to call another time. It is extremely difficult and frustrated in trying to navigate the system.    Ask EDD does not search the EDD website instead it takes you to web pages. It is useless.     The FAQ 's are out of date and some web links are no longer working. We need updated FAQ's and updated web pages with current information.,N
Hard to reach live person when calling. The number of calls has reached the maximum for the day when I call at 8am everyday. Its frustrating. I had issues with my disability claim and couldn't reach anyone on the phone. I sent messages online and it took months of going back and forth just to resolve it.,N
Hard to talk to actual person,N
Hard to understand what to do next. Should make it clear that you need to complete everything until you get a RE number. If someone doesn't finish notify them by email that they are not yet finished completing application.,N
Have attempted to call different hours and different days throughout the work week but can never get through to a worker to talk too.,N

I did the online bullshit and it sucks portion of my claim was denied because I was not under the care of a doctor. That's not true my care started the day I was referred to this doctor and had to go do blood work leading up to surgery. I think you people need look up definitions of what under care means. The problem is your online link to appeal does not work and if you answered the stupid phones, I may have been able to get help. You people make me sick. We as tax payers I have worked almost my whole life and when I need assistance I get this bullshit poor excuse of a government assistant program that does nothing but make me sick to my stomach. I had to stand for two hours in line outside at your Sacramento office only to be told fill out and return us. This make me sick because i was still recovering from surgery.

I am still unclear . My appeal claim has been approved. I have been waiting for EDD to decided to pay me the backed up amount which has been updated in the file. There is no transparency in the progress of the claim,N

I appreciate the timely manner and the help that I get when I drive all the way to [CITY1] from [CITY2] California but I find it and inconvenience if people were to answer the phone the only way I get help is if I come down and wait the 30 minutes for someone to call me back then everything is okay. I believe they should hire more people to work from home or in the office who have compassionate hearts and are willing to help those who are in need I would love to apply one day and help I've heard of people waiting a year 6 months and more to get their benefits started there should be more human kindness especially for the disabled but I always get the help thank you so much for processing my paperwork in a Atimely manner. If you need more information please contact me at [PHONE NUMBER],P
I asked a question 3 weeks ago and never got an answer.,N
"I asked EDD to call me almost every day for the 12 weeks of my FMLA and never got a call back. I had not been paid out all that time even though a claim was approved which created more of a hardship on me. I had to go to the local EDD office and wait, and then the computer system went down, I still waited, and thank goodness I did because of so many people leaving I was seen just in time before the day ended.  The woman who helped me was surprised that no one contacted me and she fixed my issues in less than 2 minutes. I finally have received my 12 weeks of benefits and am now on schedule in the system.",O
"I asked for updates multiple times. I did not get any after the initial one saying I was missing paperwork. I could not get ahold of anyone via phone. It would just say there was nobody to answer my call and hang up.   My doctor made a mistake online, and after that it would not let them submit anything online. I had to wait for paperwork to be sent. Then, after that, I just sat and waited not knowing anything for weeks. I even tried to do the online survey link, and it would not link you to the survey. It seems preposterous that this is an actual state run 'business. '  You hang onto taxpayer money, and then make it nearly impossible for them to access it? I don't understand how people can defraud this system when you cannot even receive help, and your online system and communication tools are all severely broken.",N
I asked several times about claim status go no answer,N
"I attempted to call EDD for clarification on the type of claim and process only to hear the maximum amount of callers were waiting and was hung up on, that didn't help me at all and made me uneasy delaying the process as I'm the sole provider for my kids.",N
I been trying to talk to somebody over the phone and isn't always busy ! I could not connect thru your web page,N
"I called every day for a whole week, several times a day and was never able to speak to someone. I ended up just using my vacation hours because of how difficult it was to file SDI.",N
I called several times never got an answer was always told (recording) maximum number already. I looked to the website and no where to ask questions that a EDD person could respond to perhaps same day,N
I called your technical assistance  number because the verification email was not being sent when I was attempting to set up a new account so I could apply for disability benefits. I was advised this is a known issue and has been an issue for over 3 weeks with no resolution date known. The only option is to file a paper application. There is no notice to the public on your website. Terrible.,N
I can never get ahold of anybody for any questions I am bed ridden and can't even go down to an office .! I am furious,N
"I can never get ahold of anyone by phone or email. I have questions about switching from disability to paid family leave after having my baby, I've been trying to get help for over a month so I can get it done in time and no one helps.",N
"I can never get an agent on the phone even after following the process, the response is I can't understand or let's try another way. Your web site instructions state say agent or press zero. Nothing works. I have not receive my DI payment issued [DATE]. I was told to call the bank whom the cards come from they stated that no funds have been posted. Please help",N
I can not get anyone to respond.  I have not received any payments and it's been 8 weeks.  Why does no one respond? I need someone to call me with my status.

I cannot change my password it says the information is not correcr,O
I cannot get a hold of ANYONE   I HAVE CALLED BACK SEVERAL TIMES. I'M DISAPPOINTED.  I am disabled how am I supposed to go to the office??,N
I cannot get ahold of anyone regarding my delay in payment. Phone lines are busy for every phone number listed. No one answers the inquiries from Ask EDD. I have not been paid in one month. This is unacceptable.,N
I cannot get through to anyone on the phone and the website,N
I cannot speak as I had a total [MEDICAL PROCEDURE] in [YEAR]. All help says to call EDD. I can't speak,O
I can't access forms. Nothing my doctors sent are available in 'forms sent' but I know you have tons of forms sent by my doctor.  When I call it says no disability claim pending with my claim number. It tells me there are 'forms pending that require my review'. When I click on it there no forms for me to fill out,O
"I can't access my account in order to be paid for my medical leave. I went in to the office to get help, waited for 3 hours just for them to call and 'send an email' to help me sign in but never received any email and they hung up.",N

I can't sign in because in 2018 I received a disbursement and I don't know the last total I've called 6 times and your system says no rep available and hangs up. This is beyond frustrating I just need the total from the last payment and I should be good on my own. I've tried entering my social and it says I do not have a claim I need a live person to help get me into the system so  I can properly apply for disability,N
I changed my comunication preerence to speed up the process but i can't find the form  2500A rev.3(3-112) it's not easy to find . so i can send it to you so i can get my payment,O
"I completed my form in[DATE1] and was disqualified. It took until [DATE2] for me to learn that my provider had transcribed his license incorrectly by one digit thus making it impossible to get for me to gain any payment from unemployment, or disability until it had been discovered   while meeting with a civilian insurance agent at the office.",O
I could leave a message to the office and someone got back to me in a few days thru the website.  This part of the site did work good.,O
"I could never get ahold of anyone, there is no one to answer phones. My claim has been denied even though I submitted all proper documentation from my doctor putting me on disability. I haven't been allowed to work and haven't been paid, it's been a month. Everytime I call, I get disconnected because there is no one to answer. You can't email anyone. The FAQ doesn't answer my questions, and the contact page is useless",N
I could never get through on the phone and the help button was not helpful,N
I could never reach a representative via the phone.  I always got a recording.,N
"I could never reach by phone, and using the email option took forever if I ever got a response.",N
I could not complete my application. It would not let me fill in my job information. I called in and spoke with Janet and she said she had no clue about your website. She never saw the  application? So she mailing me papers to apply.,N
I could not go forward in my EDD because something was prevent a code e 4 32,O
I couldn't find the particular information pertaining to me!,O
"I couldn't get pass the claimant registration, use if other name section. Gave me error and referred me to the 800 number which was no help and the zero for a representative was not available at all.  No access to a live representative was ridiculous.  A live representative is a MUST!!! ...but it was not available. Totally frustrating. I can't believe this is a U.S. government system!",N
I couldn't get the help needed to complete my task.,N
"I couldn't get through by phone so I submitted an update request online and never received a response. I went to the office and learned the forms I submitted to EDD weren't processed. The representative was extremely rude, patronizing, and constantly interrupted me.    When I was pregnant, my doctor submitted a work status placing me off work through [DATE1] based on a [DATE2] due date and this was approved by EDD. I explained that I had my baby on [DATE3] and my doctor gave me a new work status extending my disability through [DATE4] because my due date was off by one day. The representative told me my doctors note doesn't matter and I'm only approved through [DATE4] based on my [DATE3] delivery date. I asked how I was approved through [DATE1] based on a [DATE2] due date and after I had my baby one day later, I am still only approved through [DATE4] even with a new work status. She didn't have an answer and told me it wouldn't matter if I submit a new work status from my doctor.",N
"I couldn't log in , attempted as much as they would allow me to do so. I changed my password, still to no avail, it wouldn't let let read my messages . I have knowledge of what they are sending me. Thanks",O
"I couldn't make an online account for several weeks, had to do a paper form. I received no contact anywhere status of appl. Said call which is useless because you can't get through 20+ calls. No update info ever available and no papers sent. Awful experience.",N
"I did everything that was required of me and my doctor. However, I got a message I missed something, still have no idea what. My doctors office filled out their part and had sent it in. I tried calling as I received a phone call also but I was not given an extension and I got caught in the automated messages. Very frustrating.",N
I did it so it was helpful,P
I did not like that the process isn't as automated as it should be,N
I didn't get the answer I needed at all.,N
I didn't know my security question it took me 1.5 weeks to get through to tech. Support and the office couldn't help me.,N
I didn't know what to do then I checked on line and then began to read there I found my answer.,N
I didn't receive the [DATE] /DE 2593 DI Claim Status/Eligibility document.I have conItacted EDD many times.Hope to get to get a response soon!,O
"I do not understand the DI website at all and I have never made contact with anyone on the phone after multiple attempts. I still don't understand the pay schedule? I got paid for 4 days the first time after waiting week, and just got paid for 8 days. I would think you'd either get 7 days or 14. Can someone please let me know the pay schedule? I filed starting [DATE]",N
I don't know if I am the best computer operator but navigating through the site is sometimes confusing.,N
"I don't remember specific example right now. I have found that it's necessary to speak with representative periodically throughout the claim filing process to be sure things are moving forward and you're NOT waiting and waiting only to find out there's something else that needs to be completed, causing another delay. Hope that makes sense because each time I've had to file a claim and think everything is submitted and just waiting for processing, I wait and wait, to find out there's something else that needs to be done",N
"I don't remember the specifics. I had a claim a year ago, but this year I had forgotten the 'ins and outs' and your web site was very helpful. Mostly a refresher.",P
I don't understand something so I gust call,O
I email for claim update daily for over a month and no response. I filed for disability over a month ago no response or payment. It is unfair I put money into disability for many years and now that I need it. I have no penny to my name and been out of work for almost 3 months and no money,N
I emailed disability for update as my payments stoped and after several times with no response I had to go into an office for update and correction of errors to restart payments,N
I emailed under the 'contact us' and never recceived a response. It's extremely difficult to get through on the phones. It took several days of repeatedly calling in and being told to call back. Super frustrating/exhausting/disheartening while trying to heal from extensive surgery.,N
I feel it was easy to fill out the application for disability and easy to find what to click on the website,P
I feel that all your go to pages gave me the information I needed to go forward with my claim.,P
I felt that your Disability Services Website was extremely user-friendly.  We appreciate your quality customer services.,P
"I filed my DI claim on [DATE1] and EDD received it on [DATE2]. I have not received the letter of Compulation, I haven't gotten any replies to my 6 emails reaching out for help regarding my claim and when I will be paid. This is by far the worst experience I've ever had and the first time too that I've ever applied for disability. I NEED HELP! I haven't even been able to speak to a human, day after day I have tried. I just don't know what to do anymore. According to your website I should've been paid 2 weeks ago? Well I haven't even talked to anyone. Please help me!!",N
"I filled for EDD unemployment online during the Obama administration & was able to complete it & get benefits. In 2023, I applied for unemployment and forgot how to do it. I printed a paper application & mailed to EDD. They sent me a form to send a picture ID and county birth certificate to verify my identity. I sent my CDL and county birth certificate. EDD denied me benefits and sent me an appeal form. This time I sent everything, including a Jury notice.    Three Months Went By Before I Got An Approval And An Unemployment Check   Most days, EDD does not answer their phone. Each EDD rep game me one piece of information. One told me to use Chrome browser. Another rep told me to use my original email. Another EDD rep told me to use forward slashes for my birthday.   I would no have to call if this information was on the EDD website.   I applied for disability in 2024 & was approved, but I thought I was able to go to work. The EDD website does not say to renew a claim or start a new one.",N
"I filled out the form. Then it left a message that I have to contact the office, which is literally impossible no matter what time of the day you call.",N
I find instructions  very helpful,P
I find it outrageous that it is impossible to reach a human rep to assist with problems.,N
"I find the website a bit confusing.  When I try to look for some forms online, it takes me in circles.  I call and can never get through for someone to help guide me.",N
I found a great deal of useful information on the different sections of the EDD website.,P
I found everything i needed on the website which made it easy to do and upload documents as well.,P
"I found it very difficult to reach anyone to talk to and when I would send a message, it was sometimes never answered. Everytime I submitted paperwork sent to me from EDD, a new claim was opened and it just created more confusion.",N
i found it very intuitive to use,P
I found the phone call and Services very difficult to deal with because I never could get through to anyone I think in six months I've been dealing with this program. I got through once for an agent. I ended up having to figure everything out by myself.,N
"I found the process lengthy, sometimes redundant but generally easy as long as you followed the steps correctly.",O

I had [EMPLOYEE NAME] help me  and very informative and patient with me. Very professional,P
I had a deadline by which to submit forms and tried for weeks to reach someone by phone but was consistently told that no one was available to help.,N
I had a great experience with the customer service,P
"I had a hard time finding out that I had to file a form each month to avoid my claim being closed out. I did not see where I was told to file a continued claim form EVERY month. I thought as long as the doctor filled out a form each month that my claim would be considered as ongoing until I closed it using the form to close the claim. I don't know where I stand now and cannot find out when or if my appeal to continue my claim was granted. I'm very upset about this because I tried very hard to follow the rules but there wasn't clear guidance on doing that. Additionally I couldn't talk to a Human Being to find out what I had to do next or what I did wrong or left incomplete!!!! I still don't know what to do and wish there was a person to talk to about what to do to get my appeal granted. It seems grossly unfair that during the worst sickness of my life, I messed up on some detail in your system and as a result will lose my money! I should be able to explain that to a person somehow!",N
I had a little difficulty knowing that I had to confirm weekly.,O
I had been paid by DI for several weeks now and I couldn't understand why I had not been compensated during my pay period. When I asked the help online automated system it gave me a generic response which still did not answer my questions. I then decided to contact my local disability office on several occasions and I would always be on a dropped call. It wasn't until I had to physically go in person to the office in my walker and barely any strength to walk. To which my answer to my question could have been answered over a phone call. I am very displeased with my experience.,N
I had change my password 3 times to be able to log in.,O
I had no problems navigating through the user-friendly website.,P
I had questions regarding process time and information given and my concerns were handled appropriately.,P

I even call a couple of minutes prior to the phone lines opening at 8 AM, and I'm still getting a recording saying that there is no representative available to take my call, due to maximum number of colors being reached. It's hard to believe that there are already a maximum number of colors on hold, before the phone lines even open. Can somebody please call me? [PHONE NUMBER]",N
I have been battling for two months for payment and EDD does not communicate or process anything in a timely manner even when I'm making trips in office.  It have been entitled to receive payment since [MONTH] and have not received anything but housing and food insecurity stress migraines!!!!,N

I have been trying to claim my short term disability benefits since [DATE]. It was approved. I never received a debit card and no money was directly deposited.

I have been trying to contact disability for the last week. I have called everyday at 8:00am in between the day and later on the day. No answer. It is very frustrating that the state does not have staffing. Really need to improve.,N

"I have been trying to get clear communication about my claim since [DATE1]. It is now [DATE2] and I just got an email (after going to EDD 3x times to call in- because calling on your own is a fool's errand,) informing me that my claim is not really a DI claim but a worker's comp claim. I was out of work for 16 weeks (4 months) with no pay, waiting for my claim to be completed so savings is gone and credit cards high. Now back to work and no resolution. I don't have the time to go to another EDD center during the day now. [COMPANY NAME] approved the disability, and said EDD would have to pay. EDD says, they aren't required to pay, my employer is. This is frustrating beyond words.",N
"I have been trying to login/change my password for 3 weeks.  When I call [PHONE NUMBER] the que always says the que is full and to call later.  I have tried calling daily, 3 and 4 times a day to no avail.    Your system is broken and has been for years.",N
I have been trying to reach a representative for 3 weeks. I have submitted 3 follow up inquiries via the online portal and attempted to call over 20 times and STILL HAVE NOT BEEN CONTACTED. My payment is overdue and I'm unable to pay my mortgage. This is absolutely unacceptable and this impacts peoples lives in a very serious manner. I work FULL time and only needed disability resources for 3 weeks. I make 6 figures annually. If this is impacting me negatively I can't imagine how this would impact others who aren't as fortunate. This is despicable.,N
I have been unable to ro find out why my disability stopped when I was approved until [DATE1]. My last payment was [DATE2].,O
"I have been waiting for over 45 days and still no word on my benefits. They have been calculated but nothing has been dispersed. I cannot seem to get a representative on the line and the automated system just says give them 14 days. It has been well past 14 days. The last correspondence I received was on [DATE1] and it is now past [DATE2]. I've submitted update requests and heard nothing. A little bit of info is all I'm looking for, maybe the site or automated line could be a little more thorough.",N
I have been waiting in my disability claim for one month now . I have received a notice of computation almost a month ago . The phone number you provided for disability never is answered by a human being after calling almost 500+ times .,N
"I have been waiting on an update for my disability insurance for over a month now and have not gotten any update. Not only that but when you call to speak to someone it says they are busy, no matter what time you call, and automatically hangs up on you. This is the most infuriating process i've ever had to go through while also trying to recover from an invasive surgery. I am unable able to pay for my bills and I am struggling significantly and this website is no help at all.",N
"I have called EDD 4 days in a row a total of 457 calls were made, and I was turned away because all representatives were busy. That's very sad, that people can't help when needed. 457 attempts to get help, shame on you all.",N
"I have called numerous times at different times of the day,for weeks! and could not speak to anyone. Absolutely ridiculous! Hire more people",N
"I have called so many times and cannot get anyone to answer the phone for disability, I have an active claim. I cannot get paid, everything is in a pending status and no one to answer any questions.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR SITE?",N
I have forms to look over & website does not take me to inbox! 1 must start from the beginning of the general website & STILL hard! Seems website is designed for folk that are used of taking advantage of government & not for the working folk who rarely go into using these benefits.,N
"I have had questions and tried calling in multiple times but either the call drops because they have reached the maximum calls or unable to get a live agent. This is really bad. I need help and there is no one available to help, I have never experienced this ever before. How do you expect us to complete the forms if there is no one to help.",N
I have left a message as I noticed that there was a middle initial added to my account and no one has contacted.   I also noticed that there is a fraudulent claim on my account.   It is so difficult to reach done o e go discuss this issue.,N
I have never once been able to get through by phone to EDD. I have tried calling at all different hours during business hours. I haven't been paid for 31 days. My disability was extended and I'm completely ignored.  I've emailed as well and no response. I need help!!,N
I have never see any department like this in my 40 years of life. Considering I lived in more then 6 countries. No one is picking the phone I call from 7:59 AM to 5:00PM MILLIONS of time no one ever picked the call. It's very insultingly. I lived whole month without any income and still waiting for EDD response regarding my claim. Please treat people like human we are not animals.,N
I have no complaints! My questions were answered a to follow up with my doctor for the needed information.,P
I have not been paid on time and my benefits are missing from my disability I cannot contact anyone on the phone and my emails are going unresponsed. Very disappointed no can help,N
I Have not received a return message for my concerns.,N
I have not received payments over the last month and your telephone and online system has been absolutely no help.,N
I have questions regarding extension of my disability and this website does not make it easy. It's bad enough you cannot get a hold of a rep to speak to. This whole online does make some things convenient but does not really clarify some questions you may have.,N
"I have requested someone to call me on three different occasions and only one has returned my call which was because they over paid me. There aren't enough characters on the request box to inform them why you need contacted. I have been off of work 6 weeks. Out of the 30 days I am approved for pay, I have received 6 days. I am back to work now and no one will contact me via a request. You can never reach anyone by phone and no other field offices like [CITY] can help you. I NEED HELP! Please???",N
I have sent multiple messages over the course of my disability asking for assistance and have not received any responses. Trying to talk to someone is impossible. Took me 2 weeks to get through and even then it was because I called for 45 minutes straight hoping to get into the short listed waiting queue. I called at 8:00AM on the dot and by the time I got through the prompts the queue was full. There are not enough call center reps to handle the amount of calls received and the one I did speak with was rude and disrespectful towards me. People are reliant upon this service and there needs to be better communication from the state and their workers,N
I have sent questions no answer so far. Unable to reach anyone at disablity  i,N
"I have to call multiple times then when I get thru I get put on hold for very long time. I can call at 8:01 and answer will say, they have reach the capacity of callers. Thank you [EMPLOYEE NAME] for helping me and for taking the time to investigate and correct my claim.",O
"I have to fill 2500A and it had pre marked the boxes. That I couldn't correct. So I will go back to the office for the 3rd time and hopefully wont loose the benefits.   And if I call I've yet to talk to anyone, to bad they cant leave a phone number so we can be called back.",N
"I have tried calling for over a month. A prompt comes on to call another time cause it's busy. I've tried morning, noon, and 4. Same prompt. It says I have messages but only gives me messages up until September. I was also not paid last time, on time, which made 3 bills charge me overdraft fees. It's frustrating and confusing for my doctor also. He said he tried to file my paperwork online, but he couldn't get through on his part.  I would rather have an overpayment that I can pay back then being late. Now I am paying [DOLLAR AMOUNT] in fees. This is ridiculous.",N
"I have tried calling over and over again to no avail.  I have been without payments for 30 days. I have sent an email and have not gotten a response.  One time I was asked if I wanted to speak to an agent, I said yes and left my number. I received a call back and there wasn't anyone on the line. I need to speak to someone PLEASE. My number is [PHONE NUMBER] My name is [NAME].",N
I have tried multiple times to get assistance on phone to talk to a live person and the get disconnected as the web site correctly states.,N
I have tried so many times to reach someone to talk to and I can never get through.  I can't even get a chance to be on hold,N
I have tried to call. on hold and disconnected. tried to find a way to e-mail question. not possible. Tried to file as a claimant and it said CA DL was already being used. Miserable experience,N
I have used the government services before and I never remember which log in system to use....,O
I haven't been able to speak to anyone and get any information as to when I will be receiving any money. I've received [DOLLAR AMOUNT] in the 4 weeks that I've been out of work. I'm getting overdraft fees from my bank and I am flat broke. I feel let down and extremely disappointed. I thought disability insurance was supposed to keep me afloat during this time of need.,N
I haven't heard back in a month.  My,O
I haven't received my benefit payment in over a month and am living on pennies. Impossible to reach anyone on the phone,N
I Keep asking EDD to send me 'paper copies' and they continue to e mail everything!,N
"I keep getting error messages when trying to file a claim, i have called and cannot get through to anyone it tells me to call back over and over again. I try and still cannot get through. I cannot submit my claim. I cannot go to the office since I cannot drive. There is no help for the disabled.",N
I keep getting messages to contact EDD but have no access to your website because I do not have a Ca. driver's license. When I call I'm told that EDD needs my signature to collect my benefits. Unable to reach a representative.,N
I like how quick I go through the process ??,P
I like that you have to do facial recognition to secure your disability claim,P
I liked the fact that I received a text telling me when my info from me and my doctor had been received. It saved me from calling Edd and checking.,P
I live out of state but working in California. I've applied for disability but have multiple questions. I have tried calling dozens of times and can not get a person to on the phone. I have to send everything in the mail. I have no idea where my claim is in the process of being reviewed. I have a claim ID but when I sign in I can't find any information out about my claim. There is no way for me to get in contact with anyone,N

I love this format,P

I need help with my benefits.  I am owed from [DATE1] to [DATE2].  Who can help me?  [PHONE NUMBER],O

I need to file for disability but i can't reach you. I need help applying!!,O
I need to have my online account reset as I have called at least 100 times and can't get through to speak to anyone. The reset password does not work and no other option to get back into my account so I can get my claim finished and complete.,N
I need to know when I receive first payment,O
"I need to speak to a representative, and I have been trying for weeks, but it will not connect me to a live person! This isn't very good.",N
"I need to speak with a human being.  I can not access my account.  When asked about ID me, it doesn't allow me in.  Totally frustrating.  My check did not appear this week and I can't find out what is going on.",N
I need to to talk to a person not the automated teller service.,N
"I needed help at that moment. But, my questions, at the time, were not  the norm. I am still not working, and there is no continuing disability.",O
I needed to know which type of claim I was filing at the time,O
I needed to talk to a representative to restart my claim,O
"I personally feel like I got taken for a third of what I was supposed to receive thanks to someone not making a connection with the information provided.  After multiple attempts to contact EDD in order to confirm completion of the application process, both in person and over the phone, I get a phone call informing me that my Dr. hadn't submitted all the information  necessary including the original possible date of return, and the actual date of return to work. Because there was an extension granted, the claim was based off of the extension date and not the original date of injury. Even though all that information was available and given  as soon as it was available, yet not approved until day 50. Thereby negating the actual first week of [DATE]. I literally had to call and walk your representative through the documents in order for them to make the connection,  yet was penalized because it took so much time, yet no new information was given. Very upsetting.",N
I rarely if ever had a phone call answered. If it was answered no one could do anything to help me,N
"I real appreciate the options your website offers.. easy and quick, no standing in line or waiting on hold!  I wish other places were as advanced like yours",P
"I really have needed to talk to someone but all you get is a recording, every time I call no matter what day or time of day",N
I really want to single out [EMPLOYEE NAME] who has been extremely helpful and responsive with my claim  - and helping me correct a mistake I made in an earlier report. The human connection is invaluable. Much appreciated! [NAME],P
I really would appreciate that my payments be on time,O
I receive an error message each time with numerous attempts,O
"I received a A communication and email form that required that I contact the offices of EDD. I've called the number and I cannot get to an agent to find out what you're asking me for.. As far as I know, my records are current, including the continuing disability forms. How do I reach an agent? I've tried for a couple of days. The notification did not say what information you needed.",N
"I received a message that you needed information from me, but now I can't log in to provide that information.",O
"I received a notice to call, after trying for 2 days to get through and being unable to get through, I tried online contacting EDD. Keeps saying there are errors, there are not. Would not send my request for them to call me back. Very frustrating, I don't know what else to do",N
I received all the information I needed for my claim,P
I received an error stating my DL# was already attached to an account and it wouldn't let me advance to the form to apply for temporary disability.,N
I received numerous unexplained error messages and am not allowed to sign in.,O
"I received two emails to [EMAIL] asking me to check my messages. I went thru the verification process twice to be told I already had an exsisting account. I'm confused as to why I wasn't emailed at that account email if that is so. I have applied by mail 5 weeks ago. As of yesterday there has been no mail received. I have tried multiple times to get thru on the phone for several weeks now. I have no way of knowing when I will receive any income. I applied for SDI because I was hit  and run by a car. Driver fled. Driver had no insurance. Two compound  fractures and a broken ankle later, having to relocate, etc.etc. I have no idea when I will receive and support. That and I have to change my address but I can't access my account t do that.",O
"I regularly get no response messaging through the website or by phone call.  I learned when I went into the office that they are the same people who answer the phone and messages.  How can they possibly answer all the phone calls and messages, and deal with the people in the office?  They can't.  That's why they don't answer 90% of the time when I message or call.  It's not their fault. I MUST go to the office in person to get anything done.  Then they call you on your cell while you sit in the public waiting area.  You are forced to discuss your personal information right there in front of every person sitting next to you!  That is not ok.  I sat next to a woman who waited for hours just to have her address corrected.  It wasn't her mistake, it was yours.  But if she wanted her money she had to drive to the office (pay for parking), and wait hours to correct your simple error or she wouldn't get paid.  Again, I know it it no fault of the excellent people who work there.",N
I requested a claim update after waiting 8 was and got no reply with multiple attempts,N
I struggle with on line forms....just trying to get comfortable with working on the computer.,O
I struggled to find a roadmap or process outline that clearly lays out the process for filing and most significantly what are the next steps and what to expect at each point in the claim process. It's not entirely clear who is supposed to be doing what when. Pardon me being so frank but the phone contact is a joke. It's of no use calling to just be disconnected. My EDD is like sending messages into the void. Rarely did I get a response and the time to respond typically was more than the ten days promised. I finally sent a letter which generated a phone call. I would have missed the call if the person was not so persistent because I generally do not answer calls with no callier ID. I understand you all are likely terribly understaffed. I think managing expectations could be better. I also think you all could have a better web portal and system to manage communication with claimants. Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback.,N
I think the site has improved significantly and is much easier to use than ever before.,P
I think you need help with this survey. To respond honestly to the previous question would require a lot of time and study to review each of the links and try to recall from which one a person gleaned the most information. I think this website is really great but the survey is not easy to respond to in a meaningful way.,O
I tried calling [PHONE NUMBER] the EDD Helpline and was redirected to the website for the assistance that I needed.,O
"I tried calling and leaving electronic messages for EDD A couple dozen times. I never heard back from an actual representative until I physically went to the EDD office in [CITY].  because of my disability, it was extremely difficult to go to the physical location, and it is extremely far from where I live. I did everything else that was asked of me by the EDD department, but my case was not going anywhere by using your online services.",N
I tried numerous times daily to get through via phone & never could get through. Maximum number of callers reached every time I called,O
I tried to check my mailbox and letters about DE 2593 DI Claim Status/Eligibility. I didn't find it. I hope to get a new document to support my unemployment benefits as soon as possible.,O
I tried to see what my status is on my disability application and I can't check online. I tried the different resources and nothing helps. Only thing that works is calling and that takes a long time,O
I tried tried 300 times to call the disability phone number finally went into an office to get help with getting a hold of someone at the disability office. Your system is awful and it made me so angry and hated having to be on disability,N
I try to loggin but forgot my password. I cannot reset my password  for many day since every time EDD website sent me a link but it show there is error.,N
"I understand the ID part, but it was not an easy process. Maybe it was just me and not being so 'tech' savy.........",O
I used it to estimate my weekly payments for my pregnancy disability claim.,O
I used it to try to get info. I have a back injury and when you go to the disability office in [CITY] you have to wait 2-3hrs. Sometimes you get there and they tell you no more numbers or come back tomorrow.,O
I waited a month for my claim to be approved. It was really hard to talk to someone to help me. I try to sent a message trough the website and even like that I didn't get a response. Finally after calling like 150 time someone answered the phone and help me process my claim.,N
I want to speak with a live person and can not!,O
I was able to apply for the benefits and I was approved. However I have never received my debit card. I have requested it over and over.I haven't ever received any paperwork from you guys. I can't get a hold of a live person. I am behind on all my bills. I am trying to recover from brain surgery. I need my debit card. My claim number is [CLAIM NUMBER],O
I was able to fill out everything online. Do need better information on how to get the doctors to fill out information online. Took me a little over a week to figure it out.,O
I was able to find the answers to my questions.,P
I was able to find the right help on the website.,P
"I was able to get clarification and help from [EMPLOYEE NAME] [DATE1]about my physician miscommunication, then clarification on my claim status and benefit payments from [EMPLOYEE NAME] [DATE2]. Today I called EDD 7 times.",P
I was denied disability because they said I was getting paid by employer which I didn't. I filed an appeal three weeks ago and still haven't heard back. I have also called multiple times and have gotten kicked out of the system due to high call volume. I need this money to survive and cannot get a hold of anyone to help,N
"I was denied my disability payments. I tried calling and was disconnected every time, wrote letters, and emailed. The denial response was vague and gave zero details. I FINALLY received a call from EDD after nearly 3 months of trying to get my payments. The EDD person said a former employer paid me Income. We discovered this was not true but it was a payment for an investment I had to sell because I had no money!! Your payment delay has caused me such stress and depression. And this could have been resolved with a simple phone call. I can't communicate how devastating your inaction has been on my life and survival.",N
"I was locked out of my account and waited the one hour before attempting to log in a second time. I was locked out again and told to wait an hour before attempting log in again. I called the customer service number and was told by automated service that all representatives were busy, and it directed me to get on the web site that I was just on and log in. I am locked out and I need to file a claim. You have done this to me in the past and it took days to be let back into my account. Please hire more people to answer the phones or update and make it easier for seniors to navigate your website. This makes no sense to send us in circles and receive no help. This process took 3 hours of my day. I have a medical condition and have no time for this.",N
I was looking for information on how to find & file a voluntary federal tax withholding. But what I'd really like to address & comment on is the malfunctioning inbox.,O
"I was never able to speak to a live person to find the status of my claim since it took 19 days to finally process from the date the doctor submitted the physicians form on [DATE1]. I had submitted my portion on [DATE2]. In the end, it all worked out.",O
I was on disability for a month within that month I had to visit the office 3 times. When calling never could get through. Money Network is no good the website hardly ever worked,N
I was researching Fed and State taxes to be taken out of funds. I didn't find any confirming information online or from sending emails. I have not had anytaxes taken out of SDI.,O
I was sent a letter to call a number that Never returned my message. I called 3 days in a row. This delayed my payment.,O
i was told i needed a form number ED 2500A  but no form exist.  i had to work off a work computer because i could not access it via iphone...forms should be downloadable and if they are i could not figure it out...your website is next to impossible to understand and maneuver through,N
I went into the disability office & they were very helpful.,P
I went to disability office,O
I would  rather talk to a real live person,O
I would call several times during the day and no one would answer. My phone calls would be terminated as no one was answering or picking up. I had to drive to a EDD office and after filling my contact information they said they would call me sometime during the day. That is actually how I was able to successfully file for Disability.,O
I would like to know regularly about my benefits if disability insurance ang I hope to receive it soon. Thank you,O
I would prefer to talk to a live person when I have questions or if I can put it in an email and that somebody can call me back. It would be nice if we can have that option.,O
"I'd like to know if my electronic payment is direct deposit or am I getting a debit card and my payments are electronically deposit on that, none of the information sent to me is clear on my payment information",O
ID me was difficult; have to do video. Should have done video first.,O
If I'm looking for answers here it's probably more complex than anything listed in 'help' or Faq. Who asks these questions? And how do they manage to navigate the rest of this process if they're unable to figure out the rudimentary parts without having horrible life destroying concourse?,N
"If my Last Name mismatched and I had to wait in Line twice for more than 3 hours in front of Office, and later submit my Paper Application , still didn't get any response yet and its almost 3 weeks. Nobody Understand or realize the situation weather online or in office . No courtesy.",N

I'm not getting my paperwork in a timely manner and can not get a hold of any one or answer back from you system.,N
I'm not to sure what payment schedule is being used. I had to make two visits to the [CITY] location and speak with personnel.,O
I'm not very computer savvy. So I struggle. Sometimes your messages are clear,O

I'm old school! Would always rather talk to a live person! Making a phone call to you guys is very hard and a long process! Wish that was easier!,N
"I'm soo frustrated,  I STILL have not received the last 3 weeks of my claim, dr majors was going to let me go back to work [DATE1], he kept me off until [DATE2]. I had paperwork filled out TWICE and sent to you...still i haven't received anything more",N
I'm trying to call because I can't log in. The system is asking me for a laundry list of information that I don't have access to because I can't access my account. Why do I need to provide all the information on my account in order to ask why I can't log in? This is ludicrous.,N
"I'm trying to call the department  of disability, I started early this morning, I even called  a minute before 8am and the automated system was saying was she has been saying that my call can't go through and there are no available agents, there's not even  a call back option. It's very frustrating.  I just want to to know  the status on my claim",N
I'm trying to get in contact to the disability office and it always says that is a high volume of call I called at 8am and it's says the same,N
I'm UNABLE TO get ANY HELP AT ALL with my DISABILITY CLAIM!! I will end up having to Drive to [CITY]/ [CITY] (at LEAST 50 MILES AWAY FROM MY HOUSE) IN ORDER TO TALK TO A PERSON!!  UNACCEPTABLE!!,N
I'm unavailable to find the forms  that I need to start my claim.,N
Impossible to contact anyone  About your claim. This is just terrible.,N
Impossible to get a hold of a live person and replies electronically for communication are next to none. Payments are delayed over 1 month and creates a lot of anxiety due to unpaid bills and no cash flow for rent and groceries.,N
Impossible to get a hold of disability and unemployment,N
Impossible to get anyone on phone. Takes weeks through email to access your own hard earnings. Very frustrating and stressful.,N
Impossible to get to a live person on the phone.  Ridiculous to have to show up in person wait for an hour to ask a question.,N
"impossible to reach anyone, emails do not get answered and when they do the info is not helpful, help button does not provide any needed help. a Date was filled out with a wrong  Year by the Dr. Office - this was in [DATE1], it is now [DATE2] and still not paid, corrected form with correct date was sent in many weeks ago, no update from EDD since [DATE3] and no correspondence, no payment.

Impossible to reach customerservice,N
Impossible to reach someone by phone regarding overpayments and underpayments!,N
improve the phone,N
"In a nutshell, trying to contact EDD to ask questions never happens. U have no agents available to answer calls & Ask EDD is a joke if you have to turn in something right away & the only way to ask a question is to wait 5 to 7 business days for a response which in EDD's case is about 15 days or never. There are times when I never get a response.",N
"in prior claim from [MONTH], I sent revised claim start date and disputed the case start date for which i had submitted doctor's note. I used the online dispute form, and sent msg to  ask EDD, and never received ANY REPLY.",N
"In theory the process to file the claim was streamlined and more appealing than before. In actual use, horrible. The site freezes constantly. I used 4 different devices to file the claim because I thought it was my fault. The help offered was no help because you had to log in again EVERY TIME you used it! The other thing was that once got back into the part I needed help with, I would get kick out of the process at least twice before it let me continue on.",N
Info goes round and round without giving direct clarification what to do. Have to unnecessarily click and read so many links. It's just time consuming and no one comes even on the phone to help. If they do they are not from department.,N
Information is vague and general.,O
"Information was easy to find. I liked that, if I stopped and logged back in at a later time, I could pick up where I left off with my application process instead of starting over.",P
Initial set up confirmed even with that horrible ID me crap. I was successful. After that next sign ins could not get past ID me at all wanted VERY SENSITIVE hack me info over and over to fly around everywhere. thats criminal in itself . I have several friends who got hacked all accounts after this site. Now Ive sent by mail x3 and u never get it !!!!!! Call time over 3 hours then system hangs up on u. Iv done this about 5x's. this is a corrupt goverment system.  Ssa and medicare sites are a dream why is EDD so messed up? get me my pay!! Ive paid in all my life . I am an american and licensed professional. no pay x8 weeks. now address issues. lived here 25 yrs. what more junk can u stall? fix it,N
Intentaba preguntar sobre un caso puntual y me decía que no podía acceder y tuve que llamar por más de 4 horas para que alguien de servicio al cliente contestara [I was trying to ask about a specific case and it told me that I could not access and I had to call for more than 4 hours for someone from customer service to answer],N
It all took me back to same old claims from past years.,O
It basically walked you through it unless you're confused about questions is helpful,O
It can take some time,O
"It didn't navigate you to the proper way it kept shutting you up, knocking you off the side then you had to get a claim form then it kept pushing you off the side. It keeps logging you off the site and if you don't save it in a certain way you have to start all over. It's very frustrating.",N
It directed me in the right direction,N
It gave me what I needed to complete my application to EDD.,P
"It gives you great information, but you have to call about 300 times to get into the queue to be able to talk to a person.",O
"It has been 3 months trying to get hold of anyone to answer my questions about why I'm not getting paid. I applied online my doctor submitted the forms, but still no payments. There is no email address to contact your office & no one answers the EDD phone [PHONE NUMBER]. The AI help it's useless just giving you links to the same places that I already checked. It is so so frustrating I'm a handicap person & it is very difficult for me to drive in person all the way to the EDD OFFICE. I hope this survey will make you consider to make things more easier for us that we already in a lot of stress due to our illness & the awful situation thank you!",N
"It has been impossible to contact anyone regarding my DI payments. I have tried for the last 2.5 weeks. I've called multiple times, everyday and there's never a representative available.

My claim is open until [DATE1]; however, I have not received a payment since [DATE2]. My physician sent in the required documentation which was approved by EDD; however, I haven't received any payments in the month of Sept and October. Can someone please call me at [PHONE NUMBER] and/or expedite my DI payments. This has been very stressful and a financial burden for me.",N
It hasn't gotten through to you guys that it's been over a month since i have received any payment!!!!! My account is over drafting and i'm unable to pay my bills!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,N
"It helped me with my application, just seeing some of the questions and answers put me at ease.",P
it helps me a lot,P
It helps me to start my application and all of the steps that I have to follow,P
It is absolutely ridiculous that you cannot get through on a phone line. Repeated attempts were a complete failure. Stood in line at the office for three and a half hours only to not get the help I needed. It is extremely frustrating that you can't have contact with a human being on a telephone line.

It is impossible to call a person and I got about three different menu messages.  Online was the only way to get any information. It was hard because I tried logging in but received an error message and to call.  The error didn't tell me what was wrong and couldn't get a person to ask. I finally figured out that I had a login off my old email account and that is why it would'nt allow me to process under the login created under my new email.  Frustrating.,N
It is impossible to contact EDD via telephone.  No one ever answers regardless of the time I call.  I have a problem with non-payment that I can't resolve due to this.  My next step is contacting my state senator. I am a retired veteran and I can't sustain myself without my disability payments. I don't want to lose my place of residence because of this.,N
It is impossible to get a hold of a live person at EDD. There is no additional support beyond the website.    The calculator was not accurate to what I actually got paid for DI.    The FAQ did not cover all scenarios or all my questions.,N

"It is nearly impossible to contact EDD -- I have called so many times and never able to speak to someone. The message center only allows 255 words and you can't always say everything needed. When you do get a response there is no way to directly reply. The help button is just a bot.  It tells you all over the forms etc. to contact EDD, but after calling dozens of times, I was still never able to speak to someone.  It makes filing a claim very stressful.  I have been working and paying taxes for nearly 30 years - I have the right to access these benefits and the system should be much easier to contact an actual person and get the help needed.",N
"it is ridiculous that you have to call 54 times to get to speak with a rep. because you don't have enough employees , i just needed to call to have someone submit my drs claim  so could keep receiving benefits,  then tried mail in didnt work either , we pay your salaries , at least hire some people , it took me 5 days with over 15 calls a day",N
It is so frustrating to call Edd,N
"It is so unfair that I have not been able to get any status updates on receiving my benefit payments and it's going on ONE MONTH of trying to hear back from anyone about my payment...I have submitted all paperwork that was required and additional paperwork that was asked from me, and I submitted everything TIMELY and efficiently...However, I am expecting funds from [DATE1] up thru current ([DATE2]) and I have not received ANY FUNDS...I am in dire straits and I can't speak to anyone about any updates AND now I can't even access this site ONLINE...It feels like your establishment does NOT care about our livelihoods and we're the ones who are paying into this establishment every time we WORK and receive a PAYCHECK...Something needs to be done better to help people get their benefits on a more timely and consistent basis and it starts with timely updates and being able to speak with someone...This service is extremely UNACCEPETABLE..Please do BETTER! I need access to my funds...",N
It is too hard to talk to any person...NOT a Machine!!  It is so difficult!  I have been paying in since the early 1970's  We get treated badly...You are here to help us and we are not getting it.

It never allows you to speak to someone,N
It showed me what I needed to know,P
It takes over a week for ask edd to go through and I can call at exactly 8 when the edd supposedly opens its phone line and never get through. I've called like 10 times. There needs to be a live chat service.,N
It takes too many attempts to get help needed and many multiple attempts to get representative on phone. Called multiple times and days to finally get help needed. Representative was very helpful once I got to speak to one. Need better process to speak to live person. Thanks for chance to give opinion,O
It took a few try's to get use too,O
It took almost 2 months to process a form that I personally dropped off,O
"It took four hours and two days to complete   Signing up for a new claim which is ridiculous especially when someone isn't feeling well . When you call tech support you receive an automated system ,  everyone is too busy to help. Who ever is overseeing the disability benefits website is doing a terrible job and tax payers need to see an improvement in aa system they are ultimately paying for . No accountability.",N
It took me 11 weeks to get paid the benefits I deserved. Causing my already disability more aggressive! I am behind on all my bills.  This has caused me great financial and emotional distress that was completely unnecessary! You then have to email and call me to see if it's ok to mail my check!!! Your system is completely broken!!!,N
It took me over 3 hrs to file for temporary disability,O
It took several days for my answer whichI needed sooner,N
It took so long to get paid without an explanation of why and had to go to an office to get it expedited.,N
It took weeks and months of calling to never get a live person and finally 9 months to get processed! No appt times available!,N
It very vague when giving answers to questions.   It does not cover or give you real access to any help that you need.  Also the number to call for help . You can never get through.  It is very frustrating to say the least.  Especially if you are terminally I'll and you need help right away.,N
It was a bit confusing because I was unsure how to do the disability process and when I would call it took hours to speak to anyone.,N
It was a good source of information for someone who has never had to apply for temporary disability.,P
It was a pleasant experience.,P
It was almost impossible to call and get an agent.  I tried over 200 times to get through over 7 business days (counted on my iPhone call record). Twice I was given the option to have a callback early in the day 1130am and never received a callback..,N
"It was difficult to get my account set up and register as a claimant but once everything was sorted out and a kind customer service agent helped me understand what could help I was able to process my application.

It was very stressful dealing with the automated messaging system and then offices not offering appointments, only walk ins",N
It was easy for me to follow the how to.,P
It was easy to fil out forms. The process of having everything on line was extremely helpful. I did try calling and the public number just said they had high call volume and to call back. I got the state employee number and that was great. Fast and very helpful and polite customer service,P

"It was good to get an idea of the amount of money to expect. Specially, during these hard times with gas groceries and insurance being so expensive it gave me a general idea, but I did have to borrow money to make me until I receive my first check today.",O
It was hard to fill out forms I had to wait and at first it was not clear to me what or how to fill them out. It is not user friendly and they make it difficult especially after having surgery.,N
It was hard to get through to somebody on the phone and that's an understatement it was extremely hard to get signed up initially with ID me very hard and when you ask questions for help on line it's hard to get the right information,N
It was helpful,P
It was horrible. Can't log in. Called only to not ge anyone. Your system is BROKEN!,N
It was just very easy to get into the Website,P
It was much easier to navigate the website. Knowing what I needed before hand and how to estimate disability payments was a peace of mind.,P
It was next to impossible getting any help on line. Then I visited the offices in [LOCATION] and was never called. A 2nd visit resulted in a low and incorrect disbursement as my last job in June NPI was never calculated / credited,N

It will not let me file a claim and no one will answer the phone # it tells me to call. This is absolute ...,N
it work for me good,P
It would be better if you could talk to a live person,O
It would be great if someone would actual call to verify if we actually applied correctly.,O
"It would be helpful if a notice could me made regarding 'we mailed you a copy but for online easier and faster access here are your forms.' My caregiver who supported me had a very long and difficult time understanding what forms needed to be submitted and follow up status. Nobody ever answered or was never able to reach anyone for PFL thru the phone. However, the contact and ask questions was GREAT, Fast response, very helpful and should be recommended as the number one way to contact instead of going to the office or trying to call.",P
It would be helpful if it would not allow you to submit the forms if the date you work is the same date the physician removed you from work.,O
It's always good to follow the instructions to easily navigate the EDD website.,P
It's annoying that I'm logged in and I can't see shit about my claim but instead prompted to created an account go to verify me just to be told you already have account. I am logged in but I get 0 information,N

It's hard to connect with real person to talk and discuss the needed information.,N
It's hard to get a live Customer Service Representative on the phone. I should have received my disability payment and it hasn't come in. I have been trying to call to see what could be the delay in my payment and I can't reach anyone as it hangs up on you. Maybe there can be an automated service where we can enter our claim ID number and it can give us status.,N
It's hard to get someone on the phone and when you do they're rude. I had spoke to [EMPLOYEE NAME] who was rude and disrespectful. I had to tell him I didn't like how he was talking to me and his tone. He then told me I was extending the call by asking too many questions. When I asked if I could speak to someone else or a supervisor he got more irritated and we got into a yelling match. He obviously doesn't like his job. And takes it out on the rest of us.,N
It's hard to get someone on the phone if at all,N
It's hard to get to the forms as well as communicate with anyone. The RFI process is very non user friendly.,N
It's hard to navigate around your website. Especially when the claimant is on medication. And it's frustrating when you are directed back to this site. Because there isn't anyone answering phone calls! I'm just wondering when will I receive payment on my claim. My last payment was in [DATE]! Apparently I must be doing something wrong!,N
It's impossible for a claimant to speak to a live person and now Edd has made that even more harder and I just don't understand why is it so hard for American citizens to talk to Edd . I've sent numerous messages and not once had anyone bothered to respond or answer.,N

It's IMPOSSIBLE to reach a live person at EDD,N
It's mixed at times and repeaded,O
It's nearly impossible to contact a person.,N
It's nearly impossible to get ahold of anyone in the claims office  why can't the EDD manage the incoming calls better if at all ? I had to drive down [CITY] to visit the office in person since I cannot get any help in line or via phone,N
It's really hard to get through to an operator.,N
It's ridiculous trying to reach ANYONE in general! I cannot log into my online edd due to IDME it's been 3 months since I've been out !,N

It's very easy hard to contact & reach them I'm senior waiting 2 months I'm haven't receive my disability check since September they stop it   I can't wrk anymore even walking outside by myself  PLSS help help,N
It's very frustrating having to call multiple times to talk to a live person. Its seems you're low staff of employees to provide customer service calls. Sometimes you need to speak to live person to get some answers and the system says to call back again and again and again. Thank you,N
It's very frustrating when you've tried several times to complete the process and run into problems and you need a real person to talk to. Everything online is overwhelming we need an office with people in it,N
"It's very hard to contact by phone , to check  it everything ok on application , all day daiing no answer on phone calls, with surgery pain I went to EDD to find why I was not getting pay, thank you",N
It's very hard to get hold of someone on the phone to ask question.   I made so many contacts but cannot get hold of anyone.  No one answer the phone to ask question when the online cannot answer the questions,N
It's very hard to get in contact with staff about payments or problems. At least let us know the status of our claim and payment,N
It's very hard to get of hold of you EDD,N
It's very useful. Just need to work on your Customer service Representatives being rude & hanging up on clients after waiting hours to get through to a Rep. Even though you gave them all your correct information. Some reps. Are very rude and disrespectful & won't give you their work ID or Badge number so you can make a complaint against them if anyone was to run into this type of situation.   I think EDD & DI should have all Reps. State their 1st name and Badge or Employee ID in the beginning of each call mandatory so it's easier to complaint about an rude employee who hangs up on you & is very rude/disrespectful toward us waiting Claimants.,N
It's was okay to see website and use,O
Iv been locked out of my account for months now,N
I've already informed this portal that the State Of California really needs to overhaul the entire system. (SDI) program in California is funded by mandatory employee payroll contributions which I have paid into on every job. My last job ending in [DATE[ from NPI was not calculated into the final computation. Your office only approved   [DOLLAR AMOUNT1]. With this payment your balance is [DOLLAR AMOUNT2].  How is this possible when I earned nearly [DOLLAR AMOUNT3] dollars on the movie I worked on entitled '3' ?,N
I've applied and still no response and the computer lady on the phone can never find my information it's horrible customer service,N
I've asked question just like the help area directed me but when you ask question they never actually answer your questions  it's been the most stress time while being off having surgery to not get paid and not receive help,N
"I've been calling the 800 number for over a week trying to get a hold of a representative to figure out why I can't get into my account. This is really poor customer service. You should have enough people to answer the phones. I called first thing in the morning at 8 o'clock, and it still said there was no representatives available. .",N
"I've been trying for over a week to access my claim online, and over the phone. Each time I call the message tells me too many people waiting and hangs up on me. I am also unable to log in online.

"I've been trying to get help for three weeks and I'm so tired. After weeks of calling I final get a hold of a representative that could care less about my claim. Not to mention the representative failed to help me. Please do a better job on hiring informative people who actually care about  paying tax citizens get the help they deserve.  After waiting on hold for almost an hour, I got no where! All this could have been a faster process had I had the knowledge of just showing up in that long line in person to three weeks ago. I am taken a back of this process and there has to be a better way to process this format. I'm so tired.",N

"I've tried numerous times to call EDD-Disability Office to find out why I haven't received any checks. There's no way to get through to actually speak to a representative as after entering my code & hold for a while hoping that this time I'll actually get someone to help me. But as usual, ''all representatives are busy please try later.' I don't have the patience to call 8 hrs a day to get get through to a representative. My claim was entered prematurely to my operation date due to a bout with COVID which set my operation back close to 2 weeks. So my bills are piling up and I can't pay because of the delay from your office. Daily benefits = [DOLLAR AMOUNT1], Weekly = [DOLLAR AMOUNT2], maximum is [DOLLAR AMOUNT3]. I've actually sent 2 emails earlier this month and yet NO RESPONSE. Actual surgery was [DATE1] & today is [DATE2] and still NO MONEY.

Looks like every employee works from home. Looks like they log in in the morning and go back to sleep. Seems EDD is advising thier employees not answer so candidates get frustrated stop calling.

I can't see the app I submitted, only that it's pending andl I can't see payment I made for overpayment. (This refers to two claims). There was NO letter ID on the letter I received owing funds. I can get closure and even wrote a letter and also submitted on line with no response. Thank you.",N
More informed,O
Most of the time you aren't able to get any benefits until you speak to someone on the phone. And that is the worst part. It's hard to context anyone for unemployment mostly and disability as well,N

My doctor and myself have filled out the forms to extend my return to work.

My doctor office staff would only use 'paper form'.  I thought it would automatically come in the mail.  It doesn't.  My doctor office told me they no longer use the 'R number'.  I could not find how to order the form.  I used ASK EDD which helped me order the form.  My doctor Office decided that they should also have forms handy so no one else would find themselves in my situation.  I did try to call EDD but to no avail. Eventually my form arrived.  I mailed it.  Then I realized there was no return to work date. Opps!  I again used Ask EDD. I just now updated my form.  I really like Ask EDD.  thank you.,O
My Edd debit card didn't arrive until 3 weeks after my claim was approved. It took so long I requested a new one be sent to me express and they arrived on the same day. I was relying on the funds from the Edd for bills. Also I need to change my last name and the only way to do that is to speak to a representative but they keep disconnecting due to high call volumes. I never got this done.,N
My emails were most often never replied to. The email replies I did receive were vague and unhelpful.  I am never able to reach a rep via phone,N
My employer leaves assisted me the most with the process and details as well as answered most of my questions.,P

My issues are more to do with the customer service not the website.     The forms are a bit confusing. I am educated and a professional and still find it difficult to understand. I can't imagine what folks that don't speak English as a first language or aren't educated go through.,N

Never able to get a hold of anyone no matter what time or day I call. Unable to get help for lack of payment in the middle of my disability claim due to an error on the form. Going on for one month now without being paid.,N
Never could talk to anyone! Ever!   Confusing process- ask EDD is a joke  They lose paperwork! Long long process!   Extremely hard to navigate - even in person! Contacting by phone is a joke!,N
Never got someone on the phone when I have questions. Always unable to take call already reach limit. When leave message no call back emails no response either. Have to go to Edd location to resolve issues.,N
"Never have got thru to anyone on the phone and only able to navigate the online access once.., I am physically and mentally disabled that might have something to do with it.., it really kicks in when I'm putting in stressful situations.., really frustrating to call and never have been able to talk to anyone. It's really cold downtown waiting in line to get in and everyone is so angry.",N
Never received a answer to my question.,N
"Next to impossible to get through on the phone, no matter the time or day. Kept saying password/user name was incorrect, when I'd used it previously. None of the'help' questions addressed the problem and could not get through on the phone. VERY FRUSTRATING!",N

No clear direction to apply for di.  Just a bunch of run around,N
No hay la información que necesito y llamo por teléfono y nunca contestan las llamadas siempre están ocupados y yo necesito que me contesten [The information I need is not there and I call on the phone and they never answer the calls are always busy and I need them to answer me],N
No help   Just link after non working link,N
No matter what time you call systems are busy and tell you to call back later. So I drove twice to [CITY] Edd and waited in line for 1 hour and finally got through on phone while waiting to EDD where ever Call office is.,N
No one answers the phone and when I ask online they sometimes answer and sometimes not. Why is it so hard to reach someone ? Once you do they are so helpful and courdies but we need help ASAP it's our money and it doesn't get deposited right away,O
"No one answers the phone number provided and have received the following message, ' due to record number of phone calls no representatives are available, please call again', multiple times no matter what time I call",N
No one answers the phone the process takes way too long leaving the claimant stressing about money instead of getting better,N
No one gets back to you when you send an email for a claim update,N
No one helps from SDI.  No one answers the phone or replies to emails.  Payments are inconsistent and unreliable,N
no one is ever available to talk!!!!!!,N
"no one will answer the phones  , There no way to get any information from you !!!!",N
"No online help is actually helpful. You need to talk to a human which is nearly impossible to get a human on a phone to help you. Most archaic system I've ever seen and it's almost 2025. Also, claims that roll in to 2025 should get the new wage benefit",N
No phone numbers work and you can't get the information needed to log on.,N
"No puedo  comunicarme con ustedes, de ningún modo,mande mi solicitud de disability incompleto, y abrí otro nuevo [I can't get in touch with you, no way, I sent my disability application incomplete, and opened a new one]",N
No puedo acceder a mi cuenta de edd [I can't access my edd account],O
"No puedo comunicarme con algun representante tengo mas d 5 meses y no puedo hablar con alguien ya mande los documentos que me solicitaron [I can't get in touch with any representative, it's been more than 5 months and I can't speak with anyone, I've already sent the documents they requested]",N
"No puedo iniciar sesión no sé que pasa [I can't log in, I don't know what's going on]",O
No Reply online  No possible way to call - phone system is overloaded,N
No response on my claim. Past due any notifications or computations. Delay in services.,N
"No response, with the request update feature",N
No thanks.,O
Nobody ever responded,N
"NOBODY HAS REPLIED TO MY DISABILITY CLAIM! I'M WAITING MONTHS. YOUR PHONE LINES ARE NOT OPEN. A VISCIOUS CIRCLE- ONLINE REFERS TO PHONE LINE: PHONE LINE REFERES ME TO ONLINE.   I HAVE EVEN SUBMITTED 'NEW CLAIM' - OTHER, ASKING FOR YOU TO CONTACT ME. IT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN ONLINE APPOINTMENT LIKE TAX OR SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICES. THIS IS A CRUEL SET-UP.",N
Nobody is available!! Ever! Ever!,N
None of the link provided any additional information and was a frustrating WASTE of my valuable time!,N
None of them applied to my problem.,N
Not all the forms I needed were made available on this page nor were the instructions I needed.  Which meant I had to call in...always takes over an hour to reach a representative.,N
Not compatinle with iphone,O
Not enough staff for amount of claims. Took 1 1/2  week persistence before I was able to get through. Unexceptable.,N
Not step by step on how to apply for desability,N
Not user friendly for elderly,N
"Not very straight forward, it's difficult to find what is missing to go back and complete",N
Nunca me podido meter ami cuenta [I have never been able to log into my account],N
Nunca se puede comunicar con ustedes quiero hacer una extensión y no sé cómo hacerla porque ustedes no ayudan [I can never get in touch with you guys I want to make an extension and I don't know how to do it because you guys don't help],N
"Obviously contacting the EDD office is the worst experience in recorded history. it was on the news during COVID and the performance hasn't changed. So in the end you submit a claim and hope all goes in your favor. That being said I have had phone calls FROM the office and usually so far; those employees are quick, professional and usually pretty understanding.",O
On line filling is convenient and time saving,P
"On line is pretty good. I made mistake last time by sending in, disaster. On line is quick if you have all your documents in order. I had some questions so I just referred to the help pages. This was simple to navigate through. The go section is very helpful too.",P
Once I finally got through (it took weeks of calling) the person was helpful.,P
Once I started the process it took a while to figure everything out but once I read and got help the process went smoothly,P
"Once i was able to get in touch with someone on the phone, the representative was helpful! But that took me calling and hanging up, calling and hanging up for about 30 min until I could get through. When i used the 'update my claim' button to see if i could get more information, it took up to 75 days for someone to respond and then when they did respond, i didn't feel i got a full response. Mail sent in my my physician also took over a month to process. All in all, it took me almost 5 months to get paid. It seems the entity is understaffed or the systems in place aren't working as efficiently as they should.",N
One must guess what the directions are even asking me to do.  It's cumbersome and I often get 'unavailable' so frustrating,N
One of my claims was denied and have not been able to contact anyone. Called several times and operator ends call.,N
Online claim was not process on timely manner. Phone called and email were not answering or return. Filling online is not fast process. Need to improve answer service,N
Online is definitely easier and less time consuming than attempting to contact via phone.  It took my over 20 tries to get anyone to speak with,N
Online is quick and easy,P
Only thing i have a problem with is that you cant to anyone on the phone..i had been calling for 5 day to find out whats going on with my claim,N
Only way to contact Edd is phone witch is always busy,N
operators are always unavailable,N
Pathetic Service.,N
"People have no way of emailing actual questions. You can only hit the contact for update on your claim button without adding information.  I could not find correct forms several times.    My biggest concern about the process I went through is every form has some type of threat at the bottom of it stating if you don't do something correctly, you'll lose your benefits. People are already under tremendous stress and anxiety when they reach out to your agency. The language on your forms needs to be reviewed.",N
People need to answer the phone when they call and I hang up on people,N
"Phone lines disconnect midway through conversation, it takes 7-10 days apparently to get a response from an email and my payment is 3 weeks overdue. It's difficult to get by and I need to know why benefits have stopped",N
Phone system is frustrating. Try to call  Ringing 10+ min for automated to say try again later or no one available,N
"Pick up your phone. Hire more people, i know how to use a computer. We i need to do is not on you web site, someone from you office needs to do it.",N
Please add staff. The delay is causing me anxiety and increase inability to function.,N
Please fix login process!,N
pls call me!!! [PHONE NUMBER],O
prefer talk to a patient representative agent,O
Preferably like something read to me in case I have questions besides that good,P
Probably part of a broken record. It is ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to get a hold of anyone on the phones. I was sent a message to do an In-Call notice and I struggled to get through. I currently have no money coming in and my stress levels are extremely high and EDD adds to the stress. I paid into SDI and have a legit injury from 20 years in law enforcement and I'm currently broke and about to become homeless since I cannot pay bills. Huge slap in the face after serving for 20+ years.,N
Provided great guidance on expectation and what is required  That allowed me to better understand the process,P
"Pues todas las herramientas son útiles para darnos una dirección del cómo presentar los formularios de la manera correcta aún que como todo cada caso es diferente y es difícil encontrar exactamente lo que una persona textualmente necesita [Well, all the tools are useful to give us a direction on how to present the forms in the correct way, although as with everything, each case is different and it is difficult to find exactly what a person literally needs.]",P
Question about process to receive payment and missing documents to receive payment at,O
Questions you have are not available on those websites and you spend a whole week trying to get through on the customer number just to speak to a live agent,N
quick response,P
Reached by phone is very hard wait to long in Edd office,N
Reaching live representovr on the phone is almost impossible.,N
Reading and video helped a lot,P
"Representative never gets back to claimant, when requesting claim info",N
SDI Agent/Rep was immensely helpful and knowledgeable.,P
"SDI customer service is amazing and so helpful. Each time that I have called they have been a wealth of information, took the time and even sounded happy. I am forever grateful for their services and for the special person who worked on my file and took the time to call me to go over it with me.",P
SDI Rep helped correct my previous errors and continued my claim.,P
Self explanatory,O
Self explanatory was useful.,P
"Self-explanatory, ease of use",O
Sent several emails and never got any answer back.,N
Several times I contact you guys the information I got is very useful. Thank you.,P
"Shame on you State  of California.  No one picks up your phone to  assist. I have worked and paid my taxes  my entire life. I sent all requested documents certified mail let you refuse to pay me my money. , I have sent multiple  signatures and documents  from  my Dr, and Additional signatures. You have everything and I have proof.  Certified mail.  Do we need to  take this to  court?  Shame on you.",N
"Shame on you.  No one picks up your phone to  assist. I have worked and pId my taces my entire life. I sent all documents, signatures from  my Dr, and Additinal siganatures  Certified mail.  Do we need to  take this to  court?  Shame on you.",N
"Sick people don't have patience, and shouldn't have to.     Make This Shit Easier",N
Simple general information. My specific inquiry was not an inclusion.,O
"Site isn't that user friendly, the back button takes you out. Never a response from anyone. Slow service, paperwork mailed from Doctors [DATE1] payment [DATE2]...slow service",N
"Slow to navigate, could be very complex for some.",N
"So disappointed and frustrated. This process has been insanely difficult with multiple road blocks all along the way. I have gone to extreme lengths to fill out everything properly. I sent so much back up documentation and so did my doctor. It's been months, and I am still getting denied. I have worked all my life to be slapped in the face once I actually need help.",N
So eased to find a survey. I pray someone reads and contacts me back. [PHONE NUMBER]. [EMAIL].   Urgent ?? since only received 1 check. May have to go back to work before recovered to get paid.  Paid weekly? Biweekly? My return date pushed to [DATE] Called over 50 times. No luck! Used X the old twitter. Sent comment. No response.  Messenger didn't work.  Please confirm you received my return date. Two weeks behind on payment.  Hurting my family.  Thanks Brian,N
So hard to get to get answers from eDD whether from their 800 number or on line. I'm having issues with my miss benefit payments - can't get any answers on both. Costumer service line is horrible.,N
"Some of the information didn't seem ccomplete,",O
"Some of the questions need Assistance to complete. The wording is somewhat difficult to understand when processing also before completing questionnaire and you hit, save prevent you from completing the questionnaire, was unable to go back to complete the questionnaire or retrieve the full questionnaire.",N
Some terrific processes on system and some still need fixing   Please try to work on the phone option as it is impossible to get a hold of someone,N
"Some terrific progress and a lot of terrific people working there   Love mostly everything   Only issue you have get to improve is your phone line to speak to someone, this is the most challenging",P
Someone used my edd card. 2 charges in Mexico.  I sent 2 requests via email and have not had compensation or rely. I asked a over a month ago.,N
Sometimes extremely difficult to get through to an agent,N
Sometimes I was not able to contact anyone or get information.  Other times I had help and then I had difficulty logging in again.,N
Sometimes it's not clear what needs to happen,N
sometimes someone responds but its not with useful information and I have to call anyway,N
Sometimes the website is too vague for specific situations and it is very difficult to reach a person,N
Sometimes we need a response or a person to talk to. Having a 7-10 day wait for a response after a 3 week wait for claim response I think is to long.,N
Sometimes you want specific answers and you can't find,N
Still after 10 days no response on my claim status,N
Still cannot log pin have problems with everything,N
Still have not got paid,N
Still haven't gotten my first payment. It's been 3 weeks now!,N
still i can't log in and when i tried to call no answer,N
Still waiting to find out about my claim it's been around 4 months,N
Suffered mild stroke back in May.  Attempted to file short term disability.  Never received a check for the 90 days i was off of work.,N
System is easy to use. Slow sometimes,P
System is generally always down at night time. Phones are always busy even when calling  at 8 am you can't get through for assistance.,N
System is not user friendly and does not allow for attaching any files for the application. Phone system took 3 days to connect to an individual and then they hung up on the transfer to talk to a supervisor.,N
Takes an act of congress to get someone on the phone.  By the grace of God after 3 months talked to [NAME].  She offered explanation and followed through on our discussion.,N
tax info has to be sourced,O
"Telephone service hard to respond to. after several attempted questions,  was told no one was available to talk to and I should call again in the future. It was only 3:30 pm. Need a operator, recording, or live person to answer at the last prompt. I tried 4 times. Worst telephone experience. Thank you for question.",N
"tengo mas de tres meses y me traen a puras vueltas que me falta esto que me falta otra cosa y en fin muy mal servicio ademas de no poder entrar  para comunicarme con ustedes por telefono. [I have been here for more than three months and they keep telling me that I am missing this, that I am missing something else, and in short, very poor service in addition to not being able to log in to communicate with you by phone.]",N
Terrible service,N
Terrible service.,N
Terrible trying to get help and guidance,N
Terrific new system as long as you use online only,N
Tha k you,P
Thank you,P
Thank you,P
Thank you,P
Thank you,P
Thank you easy to used,P
Thank you for calling. Makes it much less stressful and is very helpful during a busy time.,P
Thank you for your kind help n assistances.,P
Thank you You made it easy to file and claim,P
Thank you!,P
"Thankful for this service, hoping to get my medical issues solved and back to work. Baring any more surgeries yet to come.",P
Thankful that I can have this help during my lengthy medical complications.,P
Thanks for the help,P
Thanks for the online service and I appreciate the work that you're doing for me.,P
That EDD will promptly answer the inquiries of the client thru email response or text messaging at least.,O
"That there is not an option to speak with a representative directly is incredibly infuriating. I am not receiving benefit payments and cannot contact anyone online, despite the instructions for how to contact someone online. When I call in, the lines are busy and the call is ended. I have to resort to going into the actual EDD office when I'm nursing with a newborn. This is a very poorly staffed outfit, and I'm sorry to those representatives who have to work there.",N
That's just how I feel ..,O
"The 800 phone number provided to contact EDD is no help. Waiting on hold for 40 minutes 'on cue' only to be hung up on. This is common when calling EDD. Also, what's common is the 800 number has 'too many callers' after immediately opening at 8am. That usually lasts for hours.   If someone doesn't have the ability to come into the office they will have difficulty finishing their claim.  Very frustrating. Please improve the 800 number response.   Thank you",N
The answers were direct and helpful,P
The application process was an easy process,P
The bott isn't able to answer questions correctly and the. We aren't able to reach anyone ever over the phone it's really a disaster.,N
The CA SDI has always been a challenge to get info on one's claim and it's almost impossible to get a hold of a human,N
The claim process was very clear.,P
The contact information gives you a number to call the number you call tells you to go online to contact someone for assistance. You have to keep calling back to reach a representative to answer your questions. Meanwhile you claim is delayed   I had issues finding the forms I needed only to realize they were mailed to me.,O
The customer Service local office was also helpful. Was able to help me reset my security-password login. In the beginning it was very diifficult because its been about 8 years since my last claim.  Things has changed and somethings I did not remember. EDD/ SDI offer a lot of tools to assist.,P
"The Edd has failed epically. There is not even a time of extra unemployment and edd still can't do their job in the time frames provided by law. I just filed a wage claim against my employer and edd just did the exact same thing to disqualify my claim that is very much valid and edd is committing fraud and disability discrimination and I have requested a manager callback over five times since [DATE] and not one has been facilitated after expectations were set by edd employees. I am owed three months of back pay of [DOLLAR AMOUNT]. Edd has not done their job, has committed fraud, and I want complaints filed for disability discrimination and defrauding me out of three months of back pay. This complaint is not going to go away until it is addressed and I am paid the benefits I am owed.",N
The EDD web page gave me all the instructions and walked me through the process without any issues.,P
"The EDD website is very helpful if one follows the instructions, one can find it easy to navigate the website.",P
The EDD website is very useful and informative on the claim process about how and where to start from.,P
The EED website has an answer for just about any type of question. Very useful.,P
The error message when trying to login for the claimant registration does not work properly. It should show you want needs to be fixed. You also need more representatives on the phones to assist. I just spent 45 minutes on the phone with a rep who was filling out the wrong form for me. Then she transfers me and there is no one to assist.,N
The excessive wait times along with the inability to actually speak to a representative is unacceptable.    As is the incorrect information provided by representatives.    It's not an enjoyable experience dealing with EDD.,N
The explanation was direct and to the point,P
The forms link is difficult because you have to have exact form namesof the required forms.,N
The forms were very easily understood and to fill out.  The Claim center was courteous and answered my questions in friendly customer service way.,P
The ID me is not working i need to file for disability help,N
The inability to reach a representative at SDI via phone is unacceptable.  Weeks and weeks of calling to be told 'maximum number of callers reached starting at 8:01am up until 5pm.  How are claimants supposed to resolve anything when no one can be reached by phone.   Ask EDD is useless.   Requesting a 'claim update' through portal has never resulted in any response after months.,N
The info regarding extensions is not reachable.,N
The information and requirements are not clear and lacks of explanation,N
"The information is good but there are so many other questions and challenges with filing.  Like, when I return to work, should I still fill out the forms sent to me, even if I submitted that I have returned to work and my doctor confirmed it?",O
the information regarding my claim is not as responsive as i need it to be -,N
The in-person office could use more staff. I was there for three hours. Then they went to lunch. I went back and it was more of the same. In fact the staff was hanging out in the back when lunch was over. I was so disappointed that I went home. It was a very stressful experience.,N
The language is not for the laman,O
"the least user friendly website i've used this century. frankly, an embarrassment to our state. would still be waiting for my first check if i hadn't contacted my assemblymember's office.",N
The line is not the problem the answering the phone calls to speak to a real representative is the problem. It's ridiculous how long we have to wait and then we don't even get in touch with nobody. Nobody gets in touch with us. It's ridiculous and you guys need to do a new system.,N
The o le issue is that there is no one to answer the phone,N
The office in [CITY] is very rude and disrespectful and the help over the phone is not good at all,N
The on line tutorial is Very easy to follow and understand .,P
The Online Activity is Easy and Efficient.,P
the online filing never worked.  went to edd office in person they could not solve the problem.  huge waste of time.  had success with paper application,N
The online portal is vague. Does not give actual updates. Can't speak to a live rep. I'm buried in bills and no clear updates why my claim has not been paid.,N
The online self serve services are convenient. But nothing beats been able to access live agents . Thank you,O
The online system was down for about a week when I needed to turn in some forms,N
The only issue I came across was not being able to talk to a live person. When I called I would receive a message that there were too many callers and to try again later.,N
The only issue is that it wants clear to tell me that I had to contact my doctor to submit my medical form. Please update that vecuse my claim was pending for I days i til I called the nu bet sns it gave me instructions to contact the doctor to have them submit this.,O
"The only issue was being able to contact some to find out if I'm getting paid for my extension, waiting for another waiting period on not getting paid at all",O
The only negative is it takes hours/days to get a representative.,N
The only problem is trying to speak to a representative. I have spent days and many hours trying to speak to an agent. The recording says the amount of calls has been reached please call again. Also I don't like they took away the drop box at the EDD office. People were complaining that they have to wait in line for hours when all they have to do is drop off documents.,N
The only thing that I think is difficult to navigate through is the inbox. It seems very difficult to locate which items were sent most recently.,N
The operator was very knowledgeable and patient explaining plus she had a pleasant voice and spoke perfect Spanish.,P
The phone system is the problem. I had to actually go to the EDD office to request  assistance . I was called in a couple of hours and my issue was resolved. I received a whole month of pay immediately,O
"The phone system is very poor.  If you leave a message they get back to you.  You can start at 8am., and the system tells you they have reach their number of callers.  Some of the forms are not on the list for you download and fill out. Getting an answer back is not easy and time consuming. The online system does not have the questions you need to have answered. If you need to apply for extension there's no place on the site to tell you how to do it.",N
"The portal didn't work for me to file an appeal, and I've called nearly 12 times a week and can't get in touch with sbyove",N
"The problem wasn't  online, it was calling the customer service. It was impossible at times to speak with agent.",N
"The process can be a little tricky and the process takes so long.  People work because they need the money, prolonging the process can lead to a person being deeply in debt.",N
The process is not as simple. I am struggling with depression and the process makes me hopeless and want to give up,N
The process is user friendly,P
"The process is very difficult, you can not talk to anyone emails are very difficult and no one answers you, you try calling on hold for 2 hours and then told we have to many calls for the day click hang up on you. I finally received my check after my local Senator got involved. Never no where I stood I tried calling for status put in my SS# but said not valid even when I had a form filled out, worst system I have ever had to deal with , my wife has still not heard back either on her family leave pay.",N
The process was quick and simple to process.,P
"The question I had was not included, but I learned some other things related to sdi",O
"The question in my case should've been, why couldn't I login to any/all websites.  After trying to apply resulted in, I had been mistakenly blocked by EDD and referred to your Tech Team to undo the block.  Once in, everything went smoothly.",O
"The question was re routed to another rule or website and when you needed to go back, it would take you to the beginning or need to login in.",O
"The questions are vague. Hard to manuver through sites. I was told to fill out form 4365DI which I could not locate. My Chiropracto [PHYSICIAN NAME] inputed the wrong date in Page 6, Section 4 claim information as question #3 date of trauna as [DATE1] which should have stated [DATE2].   Also reported and seen emerge testing doctor on [DATE3] appointment set by [COMPANY NAME].  Was denied financial support for medical support by [COMPANY NAME].",N
the 'real date' information may conflict with applicant 'submission deadlines' many times i am left confused as to why the 'system' is not working or responding.,O
The representative I spoke with was patient and methodical when answering my questions.,P
the representative that assisted me yesterday was very helpful and i appreciate it.,P
The 'resources' are generic information so the generic info is just that. Calling the number is a joke as you can never get in- it's been 5 days so far which is hindering me.,N
The resources are very helpful because it answers all your questions,P
The response time was horrible. Also them updating the payment portion was horrible as well,N
The SDI rep helped me understand the steps I needed to complete to continue.,P
The SDI rep helped me understand what I needed to complete and correct my error.,P
The site is fairly easy to navigate & the in office staff is very helpful.,P
The sites can be confusing. It would be helpful if there were videos explaining the steps and process of filing for disability.    It is very confusing when I log into my portal because there are no clear instructions of what needs to be done.,N
"The system has a glitch, every time I try to sign on it I ants me to proceed as a new claimant, and after I go through the process of signing in as a new claimant. Every time I sign on it doesn't work.",N
"The system is down, I have called over 20 times for the last three days, even my dr can't get on it it should not be this difficult",N
The system is easier to get into information than it is to actually fill out the forms. It also will not allow me to change my address to my new mailing address,N
The three step verification process was difficult to implement.,N
The wait time Is way too long as My bills fell behind in the process. It was nearly impossible to get through on the phone and waiting in line at the office was an all day affair,N
the wait time to speak with a representative is unacceptable.  it would be helpful if there was an option to leave your phone number for a call back,N
"The web page is very very hard to navigate, can't find anything I need , can't find where I can send questions since I can never get through on the phone or try to request a call back",N
"The website continues to give me errors and doesn't allow me to access my account status. It tells me I have 2 new messages, however I can't find or access them.",N
the website is circular and does not allow me to view any claim status because I filed on paper.  The website is virtually worthless and for the 4th time I had to visit an EDD office in person for a simple question.  Totally inefficient.  This is NOT what I want my tax dollars spent on.  Get with it!!!,N
The website is difficult to navigate and quite time consuming.  Finding answers to questions is difficult to find.  Establishing and ultimately logging into  imy account proved to be the most tedious.  It took me about three hours to file my claim electronically and I consider myself pretty adept at filling out forms electronically.,N
The website is easy to navigate,P
The website is easy to navigate. The step-by-step instructions give you the perfect guide for successfully completing the documents.,P
"The website is just clunky, I would think Ca could do better",N
The Website is not helpful when i try to contact a person. My issue cannot be solved by using online only. It is impossible to talk to any one or even find a physical office to go to. The website takes me in circles and this is a government program! Where are the people to help me?,N
The website is not intuitive.  Someone that is not a part of this process should be testing the functionality.  It is very hard to navigate.  The iphone version is almost unusable.,N
The website is set up great it's very user friendly.,P
The website is very hard to navigate and isn't user friendly at all.,N
"The website is well designed. I had several issues and wasn't able to contact anyone by phone or email (generic automated answer). I went in person to the [CITY] Office and they were incredible. Both times that I went, they were polite, pleasant and very kind.",O
The website keeps logging me out while applying. The instructions were fine,O
The website will freeze and the customer support will send to a bot  and Hang up on you,N
The website/employees do not respond. I have emailed several times since [MONTH] with questions and no response about my claim.,N
The websites are far too wordy. You need to use plain English and more simple terms. A lot of things can be interpreted multiple ways and it's confusing as hell it needs to be simplified.,N
The workers and staff are wonderful in all what they do thank you for everything,P
The workers work hard they need a raise  Great job workers .thank you for all your hard work.,P
"There are certain forms that you have to have the original , and the website doesn't tell you that it just doesn't simply have the form. And trying to get ahold of disability office via phone is impossible.It just doesn't work",N
There are plenty questions but very hard to get firm and clear answers for stress and concern relief especially in financial crisis at this time due to disability.,N
There have been necessary forms that I needed but couldn't locate them. Forms I needed to fill out that I was not notified about. I tried to contact EDD multiple times and received no responses. And the AI behind ask EDD couldn't guide me to info I needed.,N
There is never anyone staff member that answers the phone when there are questions.  The respond via website with crytic emails that are not helpful.,N
There is no information on how to instruct your doctor to fill out the form online.  There is no link.  It only says they can do it online but now how or where to access DE 2501 B,N
there is no response to any questions   totally  ignored!  Very bad service !!!!,N
"There is no useful available information, and no one answers the contact phone # or calls you back when said they will. Extremely frustrating process. Now I have a notice 'requiring my attention' and a link to 'view my message' which is a series of choices (no messages link). Confusing and down the rabbit hole. Very frustrating dealing with you.",N
"There is no way to get a live rep which is terrible for a disabled person as travel to an SDI office is difficult and dangerous - I have [MEDICAL CONDITION] and had to go to an office potentially infecting others because I can't get a rep on the damn phone.  A man at the office with a bad back had to take like three buses to get to the office and that is outrageous when you're injured.  Also, my doctor cannot make an online ID to authorize because she had to use SDI for maternity leave.  This is a HUGE gap in the process and the reason why I personally had to drive two hours to get to an SDI office with highly contagious [MEDICAL CONDITION].  Please get more call center workers for SDI - UI can go to the office, disabled people cannot do so easily and need more phone or electronic support.",N
There is no way to get in touch with anyone from Edd no email and no way to ask questions,N
"There is no way to send an email and unless you are on the phone at 7:59 you can never get a hold of a live person. I appreciate the benefits, but I have questions.",N
"There is such a delay in responses through my account. When I call I am eventually hung up on after queuing the #s they ask you to pick. I have processed the Continuation for benefits and my Dr provided information on [DATE]. I was never notified you did not received my Cert of Cont of benefits or that the Dr did not completed theirs properly for 1 month. So, we are playing catch up now. I have Receipt #s for everything. We resubmitted both forms now you are saying we were late.",N
"There needs to be some accountability on your part. It appears that one hand doesn't know the other. If you receive pertinent documents from an applicant after they were given different information from a representative, it would be sensible to update the portal upon receiving the documents. Your phone systems are horrible, and the delays only cause even further delay not making this as supportive as it puts on. There have only been less than a handful of people who have shown some human sense of regard.",N
"There should always be an option on how to reach a human being, OR a link to pertinent site.",N
there should be highlighted selections since the small black print is not easily noticeable by seniors who are not familiar with the computer system.,O
"There was a glitch in website when attempting to submit my claim online. After you enter all info and also enter info for direct deposit, it gives illusion you are done when submitting via cellphone, I waited several weeks, tried to contact the call center, to no avail. I then realized weeks later that I had not received a claim number and proceeded to submit claim via laptop.it's hard to practically impossible to contact anyone via phone and I was in the hospital. My husband had to drive out twice to an office( first time was turned away and told needed to have the waiver form completed.",N
There was no pre typed answer for my question,O
There was not a form to assist me. There was no questions that pertain to my particular situation.,N
"There was quite a delay. However, the process itself was streamlined.",O
There were some disability questions that I had to go into office and ask for a call back. I tried the website and calling number at least 50 times and I couldn't get through,N
There's hardly any way to successfully contact EDD DI. Then when you finally get someone they are very stressed and sound as if they need leave in order to function in life. It's awful.,N
There's no way to talk to an actual person with urgency.,N
They assist me too process my claim,P
They didn't answer my question,N
They don't respond to emails and you can't get in to call . I've been trying for months and weeks . Worse call center ever! This is ridiculous you can't even speak to someone no matter what day it is or what time it is smh! I even put my name on the list for a call back which I never received,N
"They haven't paid for over a month, impossible to get through the phone line",N
They helped clarify and navigate through the process,P
They informed me that my payment could take up to three weeks.,O
They just took care of all my needs.,P
They never gotten back about my status and even when I call throughout the day I can never get ahold of someone via telephone or phone call,N
they take long to respond,N
They were somewhat useful. I had to do the paperwork twice before they got it right.,N
they were very easy to navigate,P
They would never answer the phone and would always be maxed on callers.,N
Things are more accessible  and have clear understanding,P
"This appeal determination is in error of your own ID confirmations. So now in double bind, says not to submit appeal if its in error. ID me confirmed me, and I also sent twice everything by mail and special separate mail for address. what is going on here?  They never answer my delays question . There is a letter of computation.",N
This department has the worst customer service ever!  Your phone line is always busy. People are trying to get help due to disability and how they are treated is shameful.  I hope they sue this agency for the way they treat people.,N
"This department is worse than DMV. Can't speak to a real person. The web site is completely useless.The only way to get get any thing done with Edd is to drive down to the office,wait in a two hour line and hope for the best",N
"This entire process has been painful and horrible. I am a first responder, have saved thousands of lives in my career, but when I go down at work caused by work injury, I am left completely forsaken. I have never been able to reach customer service, after calling over 100 times, whether it be morning, afternoon, or evening. The entire process is a mockery and a shame. With all of the tax dollars that the government gets from THE TAX PAYING WORKING CLASS, the fact that you don't have more customer service answering telephones to help THE WORKING CLASS THAT PAYS YOUR BILLS is pathetic, trucelent, dispicable behavior.",N
This entire site is NOT user friendly and needs a complete overhaul.,N
"This government agency is the absolute worst and belongs in the toilet. Contacting them by phone which they ask for me to do is an absolute joke! Myself and others have tried hundreds of times all hours of the day all days of the week.    When asked to enter information with your keypad, you are told invalid entry and told goodbye and hung up on.   I received a message in an email stating 'be prepared to discuss the following' and to please contact SDI... Like I mentioned up above in this note 'you're kidding me' about a live person connection on the phone.  If you'd like to try this for yourself here is the phone number [PHONE NUMBER].  This agency is causing myself and my family to suffer both monetarily and emotionally...as we are dependent on the funds that I am entitled to. One should not have to suffer such mental agony.   This agency needs a restructuring so the people of California stand a chance when seeking help.  I am now forced to take public transportation to their branch office.",N
This has been a blessing   As a 60 year old to get this help has been a god send   Thank you so very much,P
This has been a horrible experience. I've paid taxes for 18 straight years and you made me wait until the point of being homeless before you started to diatrubute crumbs compared to what I am RIGHTFULLY OWED. Karma always comes around.,N
This has been the worst experience I've ever encountered.  You do not care about the people that depend on you.  Website has no information.  Now its saying I don't hav access to my claim and no one answers the phone.  During an already terrible time you made my mental health 10000 x worse.  Absolutely horrific experience and still not solved,N
This has helped me considerably...,P
This is my first time filing disability insurance due to my knee replacement. It is frustrating and impossible to talk to someone on the phone. Ridiculously impossible.,N
This is my first time navigating this on line. It would be helpful if there were step by step instructions. It would save effort and time.,O
This is my fourth week of being on disability. I had surgery almost a month ago now but never received any disability check. I feel like I'm suffering from my recovery plus delayed disability check. I have to pay my bills but worried where to  budget to pay bills. I'm very disappointed with the EDD,N
This is very hard to understand the process on line and doesn't describe well the benefits I have 4 weeks of on disability I estar the process right went I get out of the hospital and until know I haven't get paid try to get in contact with a person is impossible through the phone neather through the Web site. I very frustrating I go in back to work almost and no payment this is a nightmare. Make you sick from all the frustration. Edd disability is the worse.,N
This process is very difficult and confusing so these resources are great,P
"This process needs to be more accessible yo people that have a learning disability, this was highly difficult to navigate.",N
This set up is very helpful in a way that you can understand,P
This site was very easy to navigate,P
This system is created for people to fail or give up so people don't get their benefits. I had to call 12 times in a row which took 1 1/2 hours to finally reach a representative. Then got denied some benefits because I waited too long. Then asked me why I didn't contact edd sooner. Unbelievable!,N
"This time that I require to use EDD, it was the easiest time to apply.  Thank you",P
This website it simply and very functional I love it,P
"THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS A JOKE.  YOU JUMP THRU ALL THE HOOPS BUT NO IDEA WHERE YOU ARE AT ?  AND TRY CALLING ? THIS IS A BIGGER JOKE! THEN THEY MAKE A MISTAKE, OVERPAY ME A DAY AND THEN THREATEN ME ??? ALL I WANT TO DO IS PAY IT BACK ! YOU NEED IT MORE THAN I DO !!! EDD NEEDS TO BE FIXED !  THIS IS A JOKE FOR A STATE AS LARGE AS CA !",N
"This whole process was absolutely convenient, easy and fast.",P
"Thought help button would be more like AI chat, not just simply a sentence explanation of the title of each section.",O
Time to process was taking too long. To some of client who's in urgent that's the problem and giving hard time.,N
Timely help and courtesy,P
To be more specific of what  need to be answered or what colom more details,O
To contact EDD is very frustrating because of how long you have to wait to talk to someone.  Would be easier to be able to make an  in person appointment.,N
To contact edd office is impossible   I got cuestions about my claims and never going to be answered by computer   Edd said 'do not call earlier in the morning or later in afternoon or do not call at all we are busy',N
To easily navigate the process I tried to learn the procedures so there would not be any delay.,O
"To get info with my claim, I called the 800 # and got no help with the line. Had to go down to the office to see what was going on with the claim. I received the info I needed which was a big help they were to approve a pending review at the window which took 3 weeks or more. You need to come up with some other ways of approving with the online submissions.",N
To hard  with the calls nobody answered,N
To try and get a live person on the phone is impossible. It doesn't matter day or time.,N
Told me I'd an answer in a week. Still waiting,N
Too many steps to get in with too many log ins,N
Took forever to finally get an agent on the phone. When I did get an agent on the phone they were very helpful and I had all my questions answered.,P
Took so long to get paid.  Possibly due to holiday?   Was paid for 3 months back pay.  Unacceptable!,N
"Trate de comunicarme debido a que mi pago no aparece, pero no pude hacerlo. tampoco aparece en mi buzon de mensajes la certificación medica que recibieron por parte de mi doctor y de igual manera mi fecha de regreso al trabajo no se a actualizado en mi cuenta en linea [I tried to contact them because my payment is not showing up, but I was unable to do so. The medical certification they received from my doctor is not showing up in my inbox either, and my return to work date has not been updated in my online account.]",N
"Tried calling many times to cancel my claim. Was told no one was available and hung up on. If there is no one to help over the phone, then that should not be the only option/solution to cancel a claim. We should we able to do more online or at least an option to be called back at your earliest convenience. This is such a serious matter, esp when it comes to someone's money or possibility of them being fined potentially by accident because they filed under the wrong category. English is my first language and I found this incredibly difficult. I cannot imagine how this must be for someone who does not understand English and has no knowledge of how the process works with little to know help. Do better please, hire more people, find a solution online. Anything! Other than hanging up on us and saying 'no one is available at this time.' Please and thank you.",N
"tried filing a claim online on Dec 6 but faced a technical issue. Despite daily calls to EDD and technical support, I couldn't reach anyone for help. After days, I finally spoke to someone who reset my profile and asked me to wait 24 hours to log in again, but I'm still unable to create an account.    I later contacted an associated office, but they could only open a ticket, telling me to wait another week. This delay is deeply frustrating as many, like me, depend on these services.    Please escalate this issue and help me file my claim without further delay. I look forward to your response.    Sincerely, [NAME]  [EMAIL]  [PHONE NUMBER]",N
"Tried for four weeks to contact disability. All during the week, morning and evening, does not matter.",N
"Tried to call multiple times, I was not able to speak to anyone, had to call tech support at exactly the time that they opened, finally spoke to a live person, I had an issue with old email from 4 years ago, tried to call right back and kept getting the message that says ''there are no representatives available try online good bye ' How is anyone supposed to get help if they can not get through online or by phone or have to stand in a ridiculously long line at the one office on Hedding in San Jose that people are standing in at starting at 6 am in because the office opens at 8 am in cold weather with blankets and chairs with at least 20 or so people in this line, at least on the times that I tried to wait to speak to someone, we all pay into disability insurance but are put through the ringer to file a claim or find a solution to a difficult problem in there lives, whatever that may be. The 'system 'needs to be fixed. People need to be heard and helped. Thank you.",N
Tried to send note online regarding an error I made on a form and the myedd link was broken no way to send message or correct the error i made so i had to go into the [CITY] edd office to inform about my error. Also tried to call before going to your office but no agents avaliable,N
"Trying to call is pointless   I've called 60× one day without getting through stating that they're maximum amount of people on hold those reached. From 8 AM to 5 PM, unable to get through to speak to someone",N
"trying to contact by phone is impossible. Tried for weeks several times a day, could never get through. I had to go to the Employment office in  [CITY] to beg for help. They graciously called and connected me.",N
Trying to figure out why I have not been paid since [MONTH],O
Trying to find form or info on how to continue DI as it is needed for my case. Do I need to have doctor sign again or have a new claim with my new doctor filling out a form?,O
Trying to get a hold of someone is next to impossible.,N
Trying to get assistance on here is a joke. Also you emailed me about an item that needs urgent attention at 8:30 pm and then your website says its down from 8pm till 11:59. At 11:59 it still didn't work.,N
Two messages no replies. Phone process a joke.  Had to go to office in [CITY]. I got a slip waited 2 and a half hours then all of a sudden they called 15 numbers at the same time collected the slips and told us we would let a call. Within 15 minutes I got a call and the lady resolved my claim.,O
Two things I have found difficult throughout my disability benefits is one it is so difficult to get a representative on the phone if you have any questions. I mean extremely difficult. It could take days. Second when your doctor extends you disability and himself will not use the internet to complete the required forms the forms by mail take forever to get to you and then you have to seal with my first concern about contacting a representative,N
"Unable to do it on line, tried to get help by phone .. call more than 100 times as indicated no mornings, no Mondays .. I GOT SAME FRUSTRATION!! Getting a code, listening to the whole menu for the last 3 weeks NO HELP. Only '. I am sorry..",N

Updating personal information if you do not remember password or using other computer at different  computer center that is not compatible to EDD Resource Center. Contact via phone and Google chrome is not supported via cellular.,O
Ur online process needs work.  No reponse to messages. You can't get any automated response or get to talk to anyone.  Edd is broken,N

was helpfjll,O
Was unable to log into EDD. I attempted to call and received a message that no assistance was available.,N
We waited 3.5 hours at EDD office in [CITY].  This is during my disability. Totally insane wait for my ride & me.  I received a phone call & not person to person.  If it was on phone than why did they make me sit for 3.5 hours.  My ride missed his work too & I was in pain.  Terrible system.  Very inefficient & no consideration of patient or disable individual.,N
Website beneficial but your employees should also be recognized for their help and patience.,P
Website does not address our questions about why our DI EDD calculation and payment is delayed. Turned in out application [DATE1] and it is now [DATE2] and we have not received anything. Tried calling but could not go through. Everything is saying to wait for 3 weeks but it has been way over 3 weeks.,N
Website easily accessible!  Thank you!,P
Website easy to navigate.,P
Website has nothing useful for disability to be able to search or get answers without callinh,N
Website is better but not perfect,O
WEBSITE IS THE WORSE,N
"Website keeps crashing and will not allow login.  Waiting to speak to customer service is a nightmare. However, most reps are very nice. Example [EMPLOYEE NAME] super helpful.",O
Website wasn't that bad easy to go around the tabs it would say I have messages and didn't find any the pay was 1/3rd of my income at work so I struggled paying my bills I had leave of absence for a surgery recovery and I struggled including the dates and requests,O
"Well I have tried to contact one of the representatives. I'm in Pacific time zone and it's bare 805am, I have gotten a recorded message that says 'number of callers reached' then hangs up the phone. And I can't get past the ID.me it's saying I can't have multiple accounts. It's saying my drivers license number belong to another account. Please I need help and for other future DIs that are planning to apply. Hey that figured out!",O
Well it made it easy for me since i dont know how to use the computer. So all this helped me fill out my form,P
"Well when I tried to ask a question, it didn't answer me",N
"Well, I had a hard time first of all finding the forms. I just didn't understand a lot of the information that was given me I just I guess because it was new to me also but anyway I got it done.. Early",O
"Well. At first it was overwhelming information and instructions while being so sick I couldn't follow. Then, it was hard to log on because they had an old phone number so I couldn't verify my identity.",N
What is this ?????    It just flashes and not connecting TO ANYTHING!!  [MYEDD LINK],N
What was hard was making sure I got to the right place.,O
When calling EDD it took 2 days to get through. Line kept hanging up to others being assisted.,N
When calling EDD phone lines are always busy and it will always tell you representatives are busy.,N
When costumer service called me back great costumer service. Was able to help me all my issues.,P
"when i fill out the information needed on my claim, the website goes back to the log in page on a loop and so on, i don't know if ill receive my payments. website is glitchy",N
"When I get a new doctors note, It is confusing what to do. With [MEDICAL PROVIDER] i have to have them send the most recent doctors note thru their site, that was confusing at first as that is not what your site says. It would be helpful to have algorithms on how to proceed if you have [MEDICAL PROVIDER] versus other insurance coverage",O
"When I had a question I would call to speak to a representative but every time I call the system would say no representative was available at this time call back later. This is so frustrating because I couldn't talk with a representative to solve my issue, still haven't talk to a representative.",N
When I made it to the last page of the disability claim form it said my drivers license was there was a problem. THIS IS MY DRIVERS LICENSE NUMBER. All i need is the number given so i can give this to do my doctor.    I now cannot log in using an email to log in. i don't know how it doesn't match your records when I never used this email account. I am using a different email thinking this is the problem.  i have use  help icon but they are always too busy and tell me to try again later.  I am so frustrated with trying to use the website and trying to get through. i have two file numbers now and still nothing. What do i have to do? I sure this could get resolved with a simple phone call. Please call of DO something. My phone number is [PHONE NUMBER],N
"When i used feature,  once i got an answer back in about 4 days. It days it will take up to a week, which is unacceptable. The next time I got no response. And I've never gotten through on the phone",N
"When I went to forms and publications, there weren't any forms or links to forms to look at.",N
When I would call I  could NEVER get through. That is very frustrating. I've been waiting for over a month and a half! Very angry about that!!!!,N
When I would call it never gets threw.,N
"When it is time to 'recertification' on SDI you don't know where to go or what to do. It needs to be more clear on what we need to do for SDI recertification every month. I can't find what I am supposed to fill out. It's very clear when it comes to unemployment insurance on how to recertification, but it not the same for SDI. Please fix this!",N
When trying to call several times could never get in. Every phone call would hang up on me and say the number of calls has exceeded and would hang up. The whole time I was disabled. I could never speak with anyone. That was very frustrating.,N
"When trying to contact customer support by phone I never got through to a representative due to 'number of caller have been met for the day' and this message was received at all hours of the day.  When I logged into my account to submit a request for assistance on my claim due to receiving material requiring me to send more information that was already sent in and verified by EDD, I did not receive a reply back",N
"When trying to contact disability by the phone, it's almost nearly impossible. You go through all the prompts and you regularly just get disconnected and say that it's too busy to answer your call right now. That's super frustrating when you've waited 10 minutes and the prompt just tells you to call back later. Every single time I've called it's the same thing. I waste a good part of my day. Just trying to get a hold of someone to talk to",N
When you try and get a live person to help you out they are non existent.,N
"Whenever I call the disability office, no one answers. Completely useless.",N
Whenever I have an issue and I can't get a hold of someone on the phone because it's so busy I leave a message on my portal and I usually get a response within a few days.I'm very satisfied. Thank you,N
"Where is my claim, it has been approved,but you all haven't done anything!",O
While filling out the form about my current disability the system logs me out and I have to start over. I'm currently on my 7th attempt to submit the form,N
"While the basic information was present, it was not always clear how to contact EDD or how to determine steps of the process (particularly after filing). Additionally, when contacting EDD by phone, if there were no available representatives, there was no option to hold and wait or to receive a call back. The line was disconnected with the prompt to call another time. This was difficult and frustrating as alternative times are not always available and no clear understanding of how long it could take to reach a representative.",N
Why am I not receiving my benefits?,O
Why do you not have downloadable forms?  Why aren't mental health therapists able to certify (LMFT or LCSW)?  Why isn't there a clear flowchart of steps and red green yellow action items so someone knows where they are in the process?   This website and process is like someone from 1950 designed it!,N
Why is the state making it so hard to allot for benefits?,N
Why is there a number when there's no one on the other end to pick up the phone  it's frustrating,N
With help I was able to navigate,P
With my recent claim both have taken over a month causing me to fall behind in mortgage payments. Also I'm no sure when benefits go through but today has been 2 weeks and there is no payment. Lastly I'm never able to reach anyone by phone and seems like if I don't follow up I won't get paid even for active claims.,N
Worked to answer questions but getting paid on the website is ridiculous.   1 payment in 6 weeks all electronic,O
"Would always take a long wait time on the phone, but once I would speak to someone my questions and answers would be solved.",O
Would be helpful to have the ability to chat or message and get a more timely response. The 7-10 day delay is cumbersome.,O
"Yo yo no sé mucho manejar la tecnología pero bendito Dios mi hijo me ayudó a hacer la aplicación y todo estoy muy contenta con los servicios del programa de EDD [I don't know much about technology, but blessed God, my son helped me make the application and everything, I am very happy with the services of the EDD program.]",P
You are worse than DMV.  Stop telling people to file online while their doctors insist on paper forms,N
"You can NERVER get through on the phone. I have to drive into [CITY], Ca to get help.",N
"You can never get through by phone to a EDD representative. It's always to busy, call back and try again tomorrow before 3am",N
You can never get through to anyone for help. The claims are super confusing and if you mess up one little thing it messes up everything and you don't get paid.,N
You can never reach a live person and I haven't been paid in a month due to my disability being extended by my dr but not yet processed by EDD. I need to be paid!!,N
"You can never speak to a person to asst you with your claim or any questions you may have. The same Old recording plays over and over. Even on Sundays it states the same thing. The message that plays say, we are experiencing a High Volumes of calls and the Que is full. When no one is calling on a Sunday. So you need to update that message because it is not HELPFUL AT ALL.",N
You can not get ahold of any Live Person to talk to. Sometimes it takes days or even over a week to get ahold of someone. Also when filling out and emailing a question or concern no one replies or calls to speak with you about the problem,N
You cannot contact SDI by phone. No e ever answers. I call 10 x day for 4 weeks,N
"You cannot reach anyone, the process is terrible and ineffective.  I have not received my disability check in over a month.   I made an error and through this process you have, I am unable to reach anyone and get the question answered to correct it.  :-(",N
You can't speak to anyone or leave a message for someone to contact you when they say they have reached their limit,N
You can't talk to anyone and it's very frustrating when you have bills that need to be paid with a new baby,N
You denied me and my case is with local assemblymen office   And manager working case in [CITY],N
You follow the instructions and just get errors,N
You guys don't send the payment on time & than not even a email so people don't worry as much.Then you only have a stupid robot answer and you answer all the questions. Then the dum thing tells you you are to busy and hangs up on the caller no matter how many times you call. Just check how many times I called & also tried different numbers to you & they all do the same. I am so glad I paid in for 35 yrs for this none useful service and treatment.,N
You guys have the worst agency no help through the web site definitely need work all around.,N
You have phone numbers listed and send out letters to contact you but nobody returns calls on ask Edd or answers phones when calling in.   Broken system,N
You make everything extremely complicated,N
You make it very difficult for recertification on disability claims. You don't know where to go or what to answer to recertify. Much easier to apply for unemployment then disability.,N
You need a physical office with people to help people that are computer illiterate like myself.,O
"you need more operators to deal with support, and functioning system to approve claims. I have been trying to submit a claim for 3 days with no luck",N
You really do your job. You are very helpful i really appreciate it.     Thank you,P
You say there is fraud on my account and it has almost 2 years since I pointed it out and I can still not use the website!    Impossible to get through on the phone!!  Takes months by mail!!!  I paid into a system that is keeping my money from me and trying to make me homeless!!,N
YOU SENT ME A NOTICE TO CALL AND THEN NOONE CAN TAKE THE CALL BECAUSE YOUR UNDER STAFFED I TRIED ONLINE CALLED REPEATADLY HOUR AGTER HOUR AND GOT NOOOOOWHERE THIS IS ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT AND ITS NOT RIGHT YOU RUN THIS DEPARTMENT LIKE SHIT,N
"You state you will send me a form for supplemental certification on my last check. That creates anxiety. My MD extended me 1 month before my last check. I attempted to request the D-form. It isn't on the forms page. The search function is awful and gives too many results or none at all. Contact us sends me back to the phone number that you can't call into (it is ALWYS full) and the messages inside my portal have no indicator if read. Why not just send me the form on every extension so I have it for any extension if needed. I imagine your work should be automating and reducing pointless phone calls. Can we at least chat with someone, that handles multiple callers at once. This is too stressful and makes me feel helpless. Fortunately I have [RELIGIOUS FIGURE] and he reassures me it's gonna be okay",N
You stopped payments before end date,O
You there like in castle nothing bother you no chance to get a person on the phone or email.,N

your phone (1-800) sucks...,N
Your phone system is terrible.  I spent 3 days trying to get through to someone.  It was completely aggravating,N
"your SDI dept. is extremely unreliable and does not understand my issue, your dept. never answers the phones when help is needed.",N
Your site is very easy to maneuver through.,P
Your site is very hard to navigate.   Very hard to email or get in contact with anyone. Everything you do it takes you back to log in and requires the test code.   This process should be easy and less stressful for people that are dealing with injury and not working.  We need money to pay our bills and it's just so difficult.,N
Your website and automated system says the processing time is 14 days after receipt. I am on day 36.   It is unacceptable that a caller cannot go directly to a live person when calling in.,N
Your website doesn't work & nobody is EVER available to speak to,N
Your website is not set up right and it does not answer the right questions. And when you call the EDD phone number you can never get through to ask questions or to talk to s actual person. What happened to the automation call and right now the website is down.,N
Your website is the most difficult website on the planet. It's almost like you don't want people filing.,N
Your website would not allow me to log in because the CDL I had was not found. I moved back to CA to care for my mother and have not attempted to get a new drivers license. Isn't there another way to apply not using ID me?,N
Your wetsite is too confusing. You click on something an a a hole pile of additional information comes up. I wished that I had the opportunity to talk to a human.,N
You're an absolute joke I have called from 755am nonstop until 8:10 and every single time the system says too many calls not enough agents and hangs up   WHAT IN THE WORLD. How can that be customer service what kind of communication is that? Nothing on your website is clear. None of the help articles help any answer ever at least do a chat box where you could talk to an agent through text only if you guys are scared to help someone directly,N
"You're more concerned about illegal, criminal immigrants giving them our hard-earned tax money than the very legal law law-abiding citizens in this country. when we call you, you kick us around like a football on the playing field. your pathetic service leaves nothing to be desired. some of us need that money since we are sick and can't work and yet you don't even care what we are going through pathetic, demonic, inhumane people in that diabolical office.",N
You're not able to speak to an advisor person and the computer reasons are not helpful at all,N
It's very difficult to even get a person on the phone and when you go in person they're so rude they make you feel helpless,N
"The man on window 2 is very disrespectful to women he screams at  them and talks in very unprofessional way to them i have came across this situation about 4 times when i came in he was screaming at a  mexican pregnet lady  the 2 second one the women had his baby with  her he was so loud i could here everything he was saying to  her and i heard him telling  her   ""you guys get pregnant and want everything done  for you"" . if he is ur Spanish speaker he is doin a horrible job you guys need to check himâ¦  i been  here for about 20 min and  his behavior is disturbing",N
Very bad service The lady I got was rude,N
Worker sitting outside was very rude and told us in a rude manner that we were not allowed to stand in the hallway to wait as we were standing in the hallway with our newborn since it was extremely crowded in the small waiting area.,N
"Since you don't answer any phone call makes it hard for me to come in person to just get my question answered however the wait time is over 2 hours, people who are in disability are not able to travel easily that is why they're on disability but it seems you are careless and you don't care about any feedback",N
Very rude and not helpful,N
"Representatives are very rude and not helpful,they will tell to figure it out and send you on your way no sempathy fir anyone even when dropping off paperwork",N
The employees at SDI office are rude and their answers don't make sense and contradictory.,N
"This is a very horrible process, I have been trying to file a claim for 3 weeks and the information on the automated system is not helpful the representatives that call you back are not helpful or knowledgeable.You have security guards asking people questions as if the are state employees. This is not and have not been a reasonable experience to say the least, in fact it's and overwhelming horrible experience while trying to recover from surgery.",N
"The lady that helped me today was very helpful, but the wait time is ridiculous and waiting on a phone call is worse, they only call once should at least try twice and when I was on a a phone call the representative had a bad attitude and put me on hold for over three hours and the call was disconnected. I'm concerned because she said my address was not correct when I've been at the same address for the last six years very difficult process when all I need is a receipt number for my doctor",N
the worst check in process.,N
"Very slow service, very unfriendly maybe oberworked staff, information not clear enough online, phone lines always busy- I try multiple several times a week to call and can't get through",N
"Every one saying even people from work that u won't get paid until 3 months, unfortunately this service unfortunately takes this long",N
Horrible custom service and not polite!,N
It was very hurtful to hear how some of the employees spoke to others and how they treated others especially of Hispanic decent,N
Lack of communication to recipient of not having staff to read tge de form to continue timely payments  Resulting in payment delay affecting other payments I need to make,N
Deberian mejor el servicio nadie en la Ventanilla atendiendo llaman los numeros pero se toman 2 hrs en atender sin respuestas acertadas,N
"It is impossible  to get anyone to answers the phones and it's all automated  and when u push to speak  with a human the system hangs up every time becase ""there's busy doesn't matter if you call the posable  second they open or towrds closing every day there open they phone side just hangs up no matter what and there is no accommodations for peaple with disability waiting outside as every time the inside is always packed out and when bring up the issue told that management won't change anything for out side peaple waiting to be seen",N
"Horrible customer service, the whole system is horrible. The agents at the office have no knowledge of anything",N
I'm shocked that no one in the office wanted to assist me.,N
"The employees at this office are very unprofessional, they need to gain more training to answer the questions in regards off Edd or possible hire more employees as these employees have bad costumer service due to being overwhelmed by the amount of people coming in",N
They need to have interpreter because alot of people could not be helped because language and the workers were very rude,N
On Friday September 27th I visited the chino disability office I received a call back from a man named Jamal at around 10:50 am.  I felt very disrespected and yelled and and rude to me I asked to speak to a supervisor. And he would not transfer me I felt very defeated and it made my anxiety go up this was not a good experience.,N
It's impossible to remember the exact dollar amount of an unemployment payment from 6 years ago. Using that as a metric for logging on is stupid.,N
"There's a really long wait, they don't have a translator for those who don't speak English, some of the staff it's really rude there's only two windows sometimes one this is crazy they need help",N
These people suck at answering phones or questions in person,N
"Employees at this location lie and say they will come talk to you and give you the required paperwork needed. They refuse to take accountability for not processing paperwork they received in a timely manner and they refuse to reach out to the claimant when there is any additional paperwork needed, or if the claimant needs to be resubmitted. No one answers the phones, the government should really get its shit together and help Americans instead of worsen their conditions.",N
SDI services is terrible and the lines are over 2 hours waiting  for a simple answer. It is ridiculous,N
Name change cause problems that should be able to get fixed online.,N
"The woman who ""helped"" me was very condescending and obviously irritated. I was confused by what she was telling me and asked for clarification but nearly every time I opened my mouth to ask to her she interrupted and continued on with information that was opposite of what I was asking. I got kind of an answer but she was not helpful. Im sitting here in the office feeling so worried and sad about my financial state, late on rent overdue bills, and the person who is supposed to help me with that is treating me like a nuisance.",N
The customer service representatives are bomb ass fuck. It's the service from the computer or Sacramento that's totally handling our classes wrong. It makes no sense for someone who is on leave to fight with the system to get our funding process or started.  As a union worker who helps to build America we shouldn't have to be in these offices begging for what we are entitled to when it's being taking from our paychecks without any type of problems or delays. This is not cool at all,O
It is absolutely ridiculous that there is very little information provided to you on the portal and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get through on the phone. This system is so incredibly broken and needs to be fixed. I am waiting to pay my bills for an unknown hold that was placed with NO MESSAGES in my portal regarding what I need to do. The is the most poorly run government agency that I have ever had to deal with.,N
No one will answer the telephones.  Mainly no accommodation for ADA visitors which should be illegal. No willing assistance for customers of identity thief. Workers are rude and not will to provide excellent customer service,N
2 claims were filed because your employee gave wrong information. Asian man with glasses didn't acknowledge that. Refused to proceess the application with doctor's form and forced to get another form for doctor for submission.,N
The staff at the LA office does not help people. They are very lazy and always refer you to call instead of visiting the office.,N
"Bro, this sucks.",N
I understand there are a lot of people and there is a process however your people do not need to be rude bc and condescending.  The man at the window 2/28 st 10:40 was extremely rude talked down to me and was very short!  You cannot get through on the phone I drive Eva hour and as half to come here and I've had to come in 4 times,N
The representatives were very rude and dismissive! Also the guy at the window was dismissive to me but when the Hispanic lady came and asked for a manager just as I did she immediately got a manager! Then after waiting from 1:30 PM to 3:30 for a manager the manager helping the Hispanic lady advices she's not the only manager but no one ever got a manager for me ! Racist office !!!!,N
The lines are outrageous. Questions are not answered. Disability always makes it so difficult to get paid.,N
This office is not ran efficiently. Not helpful,N
Terrible service all around. Rude condescending reps call you after being in Office waiting for over 1 hour in line. Whole practice needs restructuring.,N
"It takes forever to try to speak to anyone, no one answers the phone for at least 5 days or more which leads you to come in to the office",N
Por el momento no  muchas gracias ð,N
No diversity in office staff I didn't seem any members of my group,N
Cuando estoy en la oficina es muy tardado y no tiene privacidad,N
"I have visited this office several times and each time has been very useless. Only one of the employees has been helpful in over 5 times that I have visited. My aunt needs special accommodations and when asked for further assistance the employee was rude. I understand this job can be overwhelming but not all the people who visit this office are rude therefore, the employees should not be rude. Some employees should reconsider their job if they are unhappy in a setting where they are meant to service and assist people. For example: Betty. When we approached her today we were polite, anything but rude. She gave us attitude and wasn't helpful at all.",N
I drove down to the Disability Office because I wanted to talk to someone in person. It was a wasted drive because they said I would be called tomorrow between 8 to 5. Makes no sense that you have an office with employees yet you are not allowed to see them. I complained about it a the gentlemen said your not the only one who drove down here and the other people are also getting a phone call. There is nothing on your website that states you will not talk to someone in person at one of your so called in person offices. Very poor customer service,N
Your workers do not care about their job. Lazy and rude. We have bills to pay. I don't understand why no one here takes it seriously.,N
"Visit was helpful, but the online system is horrible and the phone system is horrible.Very unacceptable for a State government office. Letter received from EDD had incorrect contact information that the office staff was able to correct and make copies of letter informing of discrepancy. Had to drive almost 2 hours due to a form discrepancy on ED'S behalf.",N
"The guy i spoke to at the window was rude and unhelpful.  I wanted 2 hours just for him to dismiss me so fast without even trying to answer any of my questions.  I was trying to explain to him the reason why I didn't see the mail in time and he wouldn't let me finish and just cut me off saying it's my fault and that it's not their problem , I was nothing but nice and courteous but this rude man was little to no help.",N
This is the second complaint I make on a man that is customer service representative. He is very rude to anybody. He screams at you. He doesn't have any professionalism to talk to people.,N
"If the County of Fresno allows online uploads and has drop boxes available at their office, why does the State not have this. A physical drop box is the bare minimum",N
You need more people working at the office to expedite the waiting time and have bilingual people available at all times. Also your phone system you should have more people answering the phone to avoid coming in in person. Waste of my time,N
"Dear EDD Leadership and Administration,  I am extremely frustrated with the lack of support and communication. Waiting times to speak with a representative are unacceptable, and no one answers the phone, forcing me to visit the office. The online system provides no updates on my case, and there's no clear guidance on additional documents needed. I had to go in person to learn that a worker's compensation denial letter was requiredâa detail that should have been communicated via the portal or mail.  Additionally, the system doesn't allow for uploading documents, and warnings about duplicate submissions only cause delays add confusion. This lack of clarity is unfair, especially as many rely on these benefits to cover essential expenses. After months of waiting with no money and no updates, the process is causing unnecessary hardship. I urge EDD to improve communication and provide clearer guidance for clients.",N
I was unable to file a claim because I was told by EDD that someone else had used my SSN.  The wait and service in Oakland is horrible!  The African American security guard on 11/6 was rude and aggressive!  The windows didn't service customers for long periods of time.,N
Horrible having only 4 people helping so many with not enough seats. This place is a complete joke and waste.,N
Needed interpreter they said they couldn't provide me one that I needed to call someone I know. Awful they discriminated against me.,N
Your call center is pathetic the fact that years have gone by and your management team can't hire any more representatives knowing your under staffed but let me guess your management team keeps getting raises. The fact your office discourages the waiting area and there's clearly a waiting area inside. The fact there's no instructions on how to come up to this little hidden chamber of secrets you call an office.,N
"This place is a hell hole, and the phone service is worse. Literally embarrassing that this is the best our state and government can offer.",N
"My recent experience was extremely disappointing and highlighted major issues with the entire system and the service being provided. The staff seemed unprepared and unable to answer even basic questions. My concerns were dismissed, and it was clear they lacked proper training. This is unacceptable and shows a severe lack of professionalism.  The disorganization and lack of effective communication were shocking. If this is the standard of service, it's no wonder people are frustrated. I expected basic support but left with no solutions.  This level of incompetence should not be tolerated. A thorough review is needed to ensure staff are trained and customers receive the support they deserve. Without immediate changes, this system will continue to disappoint, leading to serious consequences. Significant improvements must be made, and accountability is necessary to fix what has become the worst customer service I've ever experienced.",N
"They need a PA system for the people waiting outside. There was babies in the loby and the cold air from opening the door to call out numbers was ridiculous, other times security goes out and lets people know outside but the one today was just on his phone the whole time and people missed their numbers",N
"Since November 23, I have tried calling that phone number 10 times a day minimum and never been able to reach anybody. Five days a week between eight and five. Very frustrating and ridiculous that there's no other way to do this. I'm having an error code after I login. Can't get a hold of anybody to help me. They can't help me at the downtown office so now I have to wait 42 days That I should've been counting in already because I have to mail the claim form which is ridiculous when I have an account.",N
This has been the worst experience. I tried calling no matter what time or day of the week I could never get through. I went to the office in  Oakland and the service is extremely slow  you want in one room for the to call your number when your number is called you think you are about to be serve NO YOU JUST GO TO ANOTHER ROOM AND WAIT !!! There are only 3 windows in Oakland that is not enough  And then I waited in line and they said we can't help you with FMLA paperwork. I was there over 3 1/2 hours please call  please call to advise 510-409-1617,N
Couldn't get any help. They stopped giving numbers to be assisted at 930am. When asked if I could get a number was rudely told to come in the morning.,N
No Spanish speakers. Long wait. They make you take another ticket if you do not speak English not help,N
"This process us horrific. We are tax payers treated like garbage. Phone lines are busy, not available. Office representatives rude.",N
It is absolutely impossible to get a hold of someone on the phone. Completely ridiculous that I have to drive down to chino since there are no closer offices to me. I have to bring my sick 4 month baby with me in this cold weather since I don't have daycare right now. I have called 5 days a week and all throughout the office hours and have not spoken to anyone. It's as if they let the phones just ring and ring. Either hire more people or tell the ones you have to do their jobs and answer phones.,N
Intake person was dismissive.  I'm not impressed.,N
It was very difficult to hear the customer representative.  I think the mic volume was turned low.  This was aggravating the client being served before me.  He kept complaining that the other customers were talking and he couldn't hear the person helping him.  This was not true.  The person next to him was speaking with his rep.  When I got to the window I kept having to tell the rep that I couldn't hear him.  This alone causes unnecessary aggravation,N
The wait time is ridiculous for both the phone and in-person. I waited almost 4 hours just to get a question answered.,N
It is impossible to get a hold of a phone representative. This creates a very stressful situation and experience,N
Worse EDD office in the state. Cannot get a number to talk to a representative.  Office should hire more staff.,N
I was told someone would call me in two hours to go ahead and leave. No customer service in person.,N
"The delay in getting the necessary forms, for needed documentation has left me without any income. I go to the office to bring the documents to be spoken down to.",N
I implore you guys to have more workers at state level to handle the claims such my PFL. I'm hurting. Weeks without my first payment and I have a newborn. This is hurting my ability to pay rent and bills while upkeeping my newborn.,N
Las veces que he venido me dicen cosas diferentes respecto a mi reclamo. Pero finalmente no me dan una soluciÃ³n.,O
No disabled person should have to wait 5 to 6 hours in order to be seen by an SDI representative. The process at the Oakland office needs to be reviewed and several changes made!,N
La persona masculina se burlÃ³ de mi acento. De inglÃ©s no fue nada profesional deberÃ­an de contratar mÃ¡s personas con mejor educaciÃ³n por que de mi parte me sentÃ­ descriminado,N
"En la oficina estÃ¡n tren ventanas de atenciÃ³n al cliente y de las tres solo atiende una persona, hay otros trabajadores que solo se pasean por la oficina, y las personas que atiende de 10 solo le resuelven el problema a una. Llama uno atenciÃ³n al cliente por telÃ©fono y nunca contestan y ni para dejar mensaje, en lÃ­nea no hay respuesta el servicio es muy negligente, pasan los meses antes de recibir el pago y con errores en dÃ­as y salario, vine a la oficina y tampoco resuelven y te pasas mÃ¡s de 4 o 5 horas para que te hagan dar mÃ¡s vueltas",N
I think there should be more automated methods to be able to work with someone like online chat. It's physically painful to be at the office during this disabling time and have to pay an uber since you're never able to get an agent on the phone. The inbox site does not work. It says you will receive a response in 7-10 days but it's been 3 weeks and still no response. We should be able to see details of where our claim is and why things are pending any why payments have not been sent. Even coming into the office you are not given information,N
SDI online is not reliable. It did not notify if you are missing a document that need to be submitted. My claim has been delayed for two months. I did not realize that my claim is missing a document until came to the office. I did try to call in for status of my claim before coming to the office but It is almost impossible to get connected to a representative agent here. So frustrated...,N
"Your online services do not always work. I was getting an error message when I tried to open a new claim and it took me from November 22 to January mid January to get anybody on the phone. He didn't tell me that I was on a 15 minute time limit. He was not all that helpful little bit rude and ended up hanging up on me because my time was up and I did not have the issue resolved.  But I had enough information to get things moving. And then they stopped and it took me through today, January 31 to get somebody back on the phone and this is calling more than 10 times a day five days a week. I got to the wrong people the first time somehow the second time I got somebody on the phone. Little bit rude. He released my Benefits because I called, but I was in the middle of asking a question when the time limit was up and he hung up on me.   I had to drive to the downtown office, which, although she was helpful didn't really wanna listen to what I had to say for the questions I asked.  There's not",N
This system needs to change . You can't speak to anyone on the phone and online is impossible due to passwords and old emails that were used in the past. This system is awful!!,N
"They do not care about the people who come to this office. We all where burning up in the sun. The security guard moved the line to the shade and a state employee came out and to everyone to get back on the other side with no shade. There where babies, elderly and obviously people with disabilities. No consideration what so ever.",N
Staff was not ready when the office opened they were still getting ready to start the day at open 8am. The first window was not friendly and didn't ask questions so that I would be able to get application in the lobby area. Instead I waited for my turn and come yo find out it wasn't necessary at all. I suggest that the staff arrives 5 mins before business hours to be ready when the doors are opened.,N
"Yes, today while at your office you had an older white lady checking people in.  She was very condescending with people she was checking in and at one point she told her partner.  I live in a state where people need to speak English.  She was rude with individuals who don't speak English.  I was very disappointed!",N
"No rep was available to answer the phone any time I have tried calling (multiple times). It took an entire day to get 3 questions answered at the office. Each time I was told I needed to pull a new number and wait (up to an hour) for a phone call back from a rep to vet my issue and come back into the office. This is a complete waste of time and resources. I was in the office from 0800-1430 to handle LITERALLY 3 simple questions/issues (restoring access to my online account, submitting PFL verification, ensuring my direct deposit is established). At one point I was even told to pull a new ticket because I forgot to ask one question to the rep before leaving the office. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!",N
"The fact that we don't get any help in person and you have to wait 24 hours before you get any help that makes your visits a waste, you guys need to work in person immediately other than remote simple questions it will take no more than 10 minutes, I saw people inside the office sitting and chatting instead of helping customers so what kind of employees are those we need help people who work and help us because at the end of the day we pay for it. I wish I can report this to the higher command so you guys can make changes to help people.",N
"This visit was by far the WORST experience. I do not mind waiting when needed but there needs to be a better system to notify those waiting when their number is up. The staff was beyond rude not only to myself but to others. No sign of empathy or care. This is the disability department and yet there is no sign of accommodations to those individuals with disabilities. Making them go up & down to check on their number every few minutes. No sign of empathy from the employees to those who are going through a hard time & trust me do NOT want to be there. An employee told someone ""LIKE I SAID NO MORE NUMBERS WHAT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND? RETURN TOMORROW WHAT DONT YOU GET? EVERYONE MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT ITS NOT HARD TO UNDERSTAND"". Beyond rude.",N
"The online responses feel unhelpful and impersonal, almost as if an AI is replying without understanding my issue. Additionally, they don't answer the phone, so I visited their office in person. After signing in, I waited for hours, only to be called on the phone instead of meeting with someone face-to-face, despite being right there in the office.",N
"Sylvia is rude, uncaring and a complete dumpsterfire. She actually had the audacity to tell me ""Just go get a job."" Hmmm, why did I not think of that? Did it ever occur, that, I am applying for disability because I am disabled? Did that ever cross her mind? Is this what representatives think is normal behavior? To treat the constituent like crap and discriminate them and act like their disability is not worthy? Do I have to be dying and dragging myself on the ground to be considered? Outrageous and Pathetic.",N
"1.5 mos of frustration with edd. i must give up, thank God i have large bank account, and not pay checks to pay check. very sad, edd. have not seen follow ups $$$$ anything, getting nowhere online or on the phone.. who runs the edd needs to be terminated",N
Why office disability NEVER answers calls???. So many people need to speak with representatives. We don't have a car to be driving to the offices . We need to be able to speak with someone from disability office. They are Never Available!!! Is very disappointing.,N
Office was incredibly crowded. Unable to stand in lobby or sit. Not allowed to stand in hallway. Health risk. We had an easy case that should have been dealt with online since it was standard pregnancy. Staff were rude to other customers who didn't understand/speak English well. Very disappointed that our underprivileged are treated this way when they are told there are systems to help. The systems are far too task driven for the average population. The office is grossly undersized for one of the largest physical/populations in the state.,N
"I am being denied my funds due to employment verification, I was told my employer is denying my current employment and that I have ever worked for my employer. I was told two weeks and it has been asked to assist in the matter and was told I cannot do anything about it. I came to office today 1/29 to follow up and spoke to same person and which stated same but with time undetermined. I then was referred to Vic (manager). 1/15 I spoke to a rep that I requested a name and manager ""Vic"" said he cannot give a name of who I spoke to. Spoke to rep.,  they were waiting on proof of employment. Time would be 2 weeks, I asked if I can bring proof and she said no,  Edd has to call and verify. A Edd rep. said to request an email to prove my employment in case it was needed. (Manager said that information is not correct). Spoke w Lyn  on 1/29@1230: waiting on proof of employment and waiting for dr. to send in results. Saw dr. 3 weeks ago.",N
"The service was extremely slow, only one person working and another helping every once in a while. There are also lots of Spanish speaking people who are not offered any interpreter service even though it is available. This should be posted that it is available and should be one of the first things to offer when having difficulties communicating. I have seen it multiple times where they struggle to communicate because of a language barrier and interpretation services have only been offered once. This needs to be more at the forefront so people actually get the help they need and are understood. This also applies to all languages, just we tend to see more Spanish in this area. This comes off as a racist method by not making it easier for people when the service is clearly available.",N
"I received error code E324, attempted multiple times to call without ever being answered then came in person and was told I need to wait 30 minutes for a phone call and have been waiting more than 2 hours checked in multiple times and requested to speak with manager and was told to wait 10 minutes then continued to wait without being answered. Poor service and was told online would be quicker than mailing my forms. I am unable to work because my wife had a c section and I am primarily taking care of our newborn and don't have time to come in multiple days in a row. I have been paying into disability from my check throughout my life and they make it very difficult to file a VERY reasonable claim. You should be ashamed of your work ethic. Please call me if you care to help someone in need 9092754768",N
This is the worst system. I can not believe in todays standardization that something can not be done to make this process more efficient.,N
"I have been attempting to contact the Employment Development Department (EDD) for 2 months, but have been unable to reach anyone. I visited the office, where staff took my phone number so that someone could follow up with me. However, when I finally received a call, the representative I spoke with was extremely rude and unhelpful. Despite my polite efforts to explain my situation, she did not take me seriously and appeared to dismiss my concerns, even laughing at me. This experience was deeply disappointing.",N
Very unprofessional. Promises to call me back but they never do. No updates and no effort to provide any updates. No one cares here. Do your job please.,N
The rate at which Edd employees call people to the windows is disheartening and a waste of tax money. As a public servant I have never seen anything like this. There are more security guards than workers. Window #2 has been open for an hour. There are only 3 windows and only one consistent worker. Everyone else leaves their windows for 20 minutes and more. One windows has been open for 2 hours with over 50 ppl waiting. Unnaceptable.,N
"No one answers the phone and when you to the location, I was given a number and told me I will get a call. I didnt have service and when I saw I had a missed call. Went to the front and was dismissed right away saying my case is active and someone is working on it. Its been 30 minutes after I walked in and no one has called me. They called the numbers ahead of me and passed my number.",N
"The staff here are horrible. I had to make numerous trips to that location while recovering from back surgery. They don't give out the proper information and furthermore don't reconcile when they mess up. I was given a receipt number with a letter on it which was incorrect and when I asked them to change it they said I had to get another ticket number and wait 3 more hrs. I've been coming down here for months and yet to be given info that allows me to receive payment. As I am about to have another surgery I need to receive income. The security guards here are ill mannered, unhelpful, and untrained to deal with the capacity/ demographic of the people who come to get help. Also for people who are disabled like me and can't sit for more than 10 min without pain there are no ways  to get in contact with anyone so we're forced to be subjected to this treatment.",N
The security guard is allowing people to jump a long line outside and not providing any control or instruction to everyone waiting. He is just on his phone watching videos. Very upsetting after I've seen some people pass me while waiting in line for more than an hour.,N
"I tried to ask questions but the employees here are heartless, ruthless and without emoathy. They are not professional , treat people like crap, and feel very entitled. They function like robots without feelings and just they don't care at all I thought government employees are trained professionally to deal with customers but the two ladies  working today 9/18/24 1000 am have no respect for people. They don't deserve to be there. The only one who is more professional and courteous was the guard on duty at that time.He said he is only a guard but he behaved more like a human being than these two women employees who were just heartless. I hope their families wont be treated the way I was treated by these two employees who worked 9/18/24 at 1000 am. Just forgot their names. I know nothing is going to happen with these complaints but at least its known they behave this rude and condescending way.",N
The process has been horrendous. Had to file an appeal.  Won appeal in April and agent never filed appeal for 6 months. Had to come into office with paperwork copies. Now 22 months after filing I'm still waiting for a response. I'm told I have to wait for the agent at the hearing in April to ok the ruling g of a judge. Most financially devastating experience ever.,N
"I feel like there is no regularity to payments that should be regular and on time. I have to visit the office to move my case forward. I've been told so many times that because I visited the office, my case will now move forward. Every time I ask why did it take me visiting the office to move my case forward? I never get a straight answer. The wait times at the office are outrageously long. I count about 50 cubicles available for an employee to be stationed at and less than 10 percent are manned.",N
"Yes! I had an appointment with one of your doctors (Dr Nguyen) on 2/25/25 at the West La. Palma office.That Doctor was not very nice or friendly. He was EXTREMELY SHORT&very nonchalant. He walked in the room saying ""This will be a very short exam for EDD. They just want to know if you can really go back to work that's all this appointment is for"". He asked me less than 5 questions. That's consisted of ""why does it hurt?"" When he had me walk to the door I was limping& he asked why do you limp?What hurts when you walk?He also asked what kind of accident caused me to be out of work?After he did his ""exam"" which consisted of him saying turn ur neck left now the other way&walk to the door.That was it! Didn't ask me anything about how I was feeling or anything!Then told me that I need to get x-rays done.When I asked him did he have my medical history from the doctor I'm currently under because I was confused on why I was getting X-rays, he said No! X-rays is just what EDD requires me to do.",N
"I came to the office to turn in documents that a telephone representative told me I needed. I faxed and mailed the documents and did not hear anything back from EDD after the post office confirmed delivery. I flew in to the area and went to the office where representative Mani was very belligerent and rude about helping me, unwilling to listen as I explained to him the series of events. I begged him to take my documents and he walked away and never returned. I have him on video. I felt helpless and defeated at that moment because I've been waiting for payment since Sept 6, 2024. It's Oct 30 and nothing.   Feel free to contact me for proof. 470-836-8636",N
The website is hard to navigate and not forgiving on mistakes. Can never speak to someone competent over the phone for any issues that arise on communication and correspondence. In person is worst the operation side of things is very unorganized. No structure and one person checking someone in and one clerk to help over hundreds of people to be seen. Not a smooth straight forward process a lot of delays for very minor things. I have No faith in the state and how it's running California economy. Poor money spent on tax payers for little to no help from state on Americans right to their benefits.,N
This office is a joke and a lot of the employees are clueless of what is going on with the Status of your file. They have something new every time I come to say. My paper work was sent since November and still haven't got paid. The supervisor here Wendy was supposed to call me with a call back on status never did receive a call back. This is my sixth time here and no one seems to help. This of is ridiculous and needs some TRAINING.,N
Wait times are so long people just leave,N
Edd needs together their stuff together as a whole. It's ridiculous the lengths people have to go through just to get their money they are entitled to.,N
"People visit the office to get questions answered when they can't get through telephone. The fact one has to waste time coming to DTLA office, when there's no parking, or parking is expensive, to still not get help and instead get a phone call within 3 hours; is super frustrating. EDD needs to do better in office and on the telephones. Calls never go through!",N
"I visited this office four times over three months and have still not received my disability benefits  In addition, I have found the staff to be extremely unfriendly",N
We came into the Oakland office for more info EDD rep Chike was rude disrespectful threw my ID back to me. This is not the first time I've seen him act like this it just wasn't to me another person in EDD at the time,N
I was unable to get ahold of anyone via phone. I have called every day for two weeks and the line aid that it was too busy. I went into the office on Oct 14th and Oct 17th to attempt to resolve but the office associate told me that my insurance had to submit an extension online (which they did twice). I had a reference number but they refused to take it.,N
"Why is everything always so fucking hard to get basic help? Maybe hire more people? Change the infrastructure. Do something. This ""service"" fucking sucks.",N
Today I visited the Oakland office. I was treated unfairly by the security guard in room 325. I made a complaint with the office manager. The security guard was very rude and disrespectful.,N
"I file intermittent PFL Bonding leave. Every month I have to walk in the office in order to be paid. I filed my last claim on 12/01/24. It has been 26 days and I have not received a payment. I have young children and a newborn baby and I have not been able to pay my bills, including my mortgage and car note  because of the 25 day delay I have experienced. This is not a one time thing because of the holidays. Every month I am forced to visit the office with my newborn and I experience long wait times, exhausted and rude employees who don't have access to the PFL accounts. This is exhausting and not how I envisioned spending BONDING TIME with my newborn. I work hard at my job that I have been at for 20 years. I have paid my taxes and I expected better service when I'm taking my time to take care of my new baby. Please pay me my wages.",N
"I am trying to file a claim. I have been trying since November 22. I have not been successful in getting anybody on the phone every time I call it says that all the operators are busy essentially and says call back later and hangs up. I visited the field office. They said they can't help me. Kaiser where I had my surgery said I have to have a receipt number from the website in order for them to be able to help me. I can't get a receipt number because I'm getting an error 324 when I login and try to open a claim. I can't get anybody on the phone. I can't get anybody in the field office to help me. I can't get anybody to help me anywhere. There's no separate phone number for this. There's no frequently ask questions that covers this and helps me other than to tell me to call and when I call, I can't get anybody on the phone. This is ridiculous.",N
"1) y'all don't let the phone ring long enough and then no number to callback. Lost turn not right. Waiting forever again.  2) At the window they just receive papers but are not informed on anything. You should be able to get clear answers like a phone agent. Everything is ""will get processed within 10 days"". Never mind I hand delivered a form that had the return P.O. Box for the DTLA office. Why would it take just as long as mailing it to get an answer?",N
Minimum 3 hour visit because I could not access account online. Call in is a joke. Ever try calling in yourself????? Ridiculous. Hire more people. Train them better. Fire top management. I'm a state tax payer for 50 plus years. Embarrassing to other states. Please figure out your damn phone system!! It sicks!!,N
"There is no one to speak with regarding my paid family leave case was informed their office is up north. This office is very unorganized and feels like you get no where. Staff should be more friendly, we are unhappy regarding the situation.",N
The 1st stop at Oakland office then a second stop with the specialist they do not have good manners or able to speak politely. I have called the number all hours everyday and message on line multiple times and no one pick up phone - and phone disconnects without a chance to speak with anyone taking time of break or lunch at work to do this. So I opted to use the message center online and no one message me back or send any mails service to let me know what was happening. Then I decided to take a ride to Oakland office and took time off in the morning to go there for help as you know the reason being off work is being ill and not being pay and this is the reason we have benefits and pay taxes and fees from work for these people who sit there to help us and taking time of work is loosing hours of work with no pay. I didn't choose to be ill there a lot of people there walking around they take care of one or 2 persons then they walked away from the window and not time to wait - please help,N
"Hard to connnect to your web site.  Password issues.  Phone call , wait too long. Phone prompt too busy. Call back ?",N
The operations process is completely outdated. I have been waiting for benefits since July. I keep receiving mixed information regarding my claim. It should not take this long. I am disappointed in this government.,N
"I visited in person because I received a letter stating that my doctor's form was not received, despite having mailed it via certified mail. Leticia, informed me that I needed a physical ID to accept my document, and my online copy of ID was insufficient. When I explained the hardship of returning, she reiterated that it was policy, mentioning that someone else had returned three times for a similar situation. I expressed concern about missing the deadline and the associated costs, but she still refused to accept the document until I requested to speak to her supervisor. Eventually, she accepted it. Prior, I also tried contacting the office by phone multiple times with no success. If this is indeed the process, it is not clearly communicated, as there is no mention of it in the written flyer displayed at the office. Additionally, when I asked for Leticia's last name, she refused, citing policy again. This process is not consumer friendly. Please consider impact.  Elsa 559-304-6087",N
With all do respect. I am very disappointed that I've been calling all day and different times of the day and you can never speak to a person. Also I have turned in my application and it's been 20 days with no response. In my opinion the system is broken and can be fixed and updated to help anyone who calls. I am still waiting for a response.  Thank you for your time,N

I visited the Chino hills office on 8/28/24 and was told they had 2 accounts in their system under my name, one with the correct spelling and one with the last name spelling of ""Niwman."" I was then told by a representative that the duplicate account or the incorrect spelling was going to be deleted by your offices and payment should be issued within week, then I should be able to log on and create a new account, & see status of claim. I was also told that I should receive payment within one week. It has now been two weeks, I still can't get through on the phone lines except for one time or I left a message one week ago and nobody called back. I still cannot log on online, and I still have received no correspondence from SDI.",N
"clients are taking time away from their care to come here, only to be turned away because they don't speak the language. This feels discriminatory. I offered to translate for a person ( I am an advocate I came here to help a claimant) , but I was told this would violate confidentiality. However, conversations in your office are already audible to everyone present, so there's no real confidentiality.

There was at most two people working and not consistently. There were four windows and I waited 4 1/2 hours to be told that PFL doesn't have a physical address and that I would get a call.,N
I emailed several times in the portal asking for un update. The response I received was your claim was updated without any further information. I called multiples times and I was told my call could not be tended to because there wasn't anyone available due to excessive calls.,N
There are three windows and nobody there to attend the people for a few minutes,N

"Sasha at the SD Office was extremely compassionate and helpful. This was only the 2nd time I felt respected by a worker at this Office and I visited every week for 2 straight months looking to receive help and answers regarding my pregnancy leave resources. The IDME website is horrid and overall my experience making a claim was one of the more stressful experiences EVER. Generally, the workers in the SD Office are rude and each providing contradictory information. I feel they hate their jobs and try to punish you for coming in. I hope my next experience goes much better, it's hard to believe I had to fight So Hard for My Own Money. This system and Office needs MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS OVERALL",O

The people you have like the security guards and the black lady and the Mexican lady downstairs helping check people in tear people worse then animals. People are here because they are sick and to be treated less than human is disrespectful and disgusting. These people you have hired for security need to go back for training. I was told to get out of a chair because the security guard was going to sit!!! If she is working then they should not be sitting on their asses shoveling food in their face and socializing while treating people like animals. I will report this to the state. This treatment is unacceptable. The customers coming in should be able to have 1 person with them and not be treated badly. My husband had 2 heart attacks in 1 week and I was treated badly because my husband wanted me by his side!!!!! Your Inter-Con employees need to be replaced all of the so called females!!!! I want a call to discuss 7076898854,N

"Office was very disorganized.  The workers are overworked and we're not treated respectfully. The waiting room was very small. You can hear the conversations of people in the counter. There's no privacy so other people can hear your business.  The only redeeming quality is the security officer. His name is Arturo Armas. Mr. Armas was very helpful, courteous and friendly. He helped direct people. He answered people's questions. He helped translate in Spanish. He was very patient. He should be given a raise and commendation because he deserves it.",N

Rarely do I leave this location with my answers, I shouldn't have to come here three days in one week.",N
1.the phone system needs to provide away to have the customer get in line and you call the customer back instead of insisting on multiple calls by the customer just to reach a representative.   2. The online system needs to have a way for out of state residents / out of state drivers license to access the online system. 3. The in person office needs to have a recognizable phone number so the customers phone rings when you call.  And please give out your office phone number for call backs.  4. The in person office needs to be able to offer tickets for standing in line for in person meetings and those tickets need to be available online.  Like at the DMV.  Then the customer can grab their ticket online and wait in their car or where ever they need to wait.  They can see when their ticket is coming due and get text messages updating them on their wait time.   5. The archaic system currently is demoralizing and a huge waste of time for everyone who is struggling to make it work,N
"The black security guard at the door was extremely rude when I asked where the EDD office was located. He said where the door is open while looking down on his phone watching videos while he's on the clock. I pointed to the door to the right and he responded with ""well yeah that's the only door open right"" I'm pregnant. He shouldn't have been rude about it. I felt so uncomfortable and he then got up like if he was going to do something and continued to watch videos on his phone. This guy shouldn't work here if he doesn't want to be bothered.",N
"When we come to office and they make us sit for a phone call rather than seeing someone in person, usually ( at least for me ) the times I have been helped on the phone , nothing gets resolved for me even if they say they will help me . Also I need someone to bring me because I'm disabled and can't drive so they make me waste the time of the person that helps me and it adds on stress and financial hardships as well.   Today that I'm here the person intake people said that there were 20 people ahead of me to see someone in person but at the office there weren't even 10 people in the chairs waiting . Also, it's the attitude we receive from them so unnecessary all I am trying to do here is resolve anything needed of my case.   When I've tried to call instead of coming in ,,, the calls always drop they never go through",N
"Everyone in the office takes lunch at the same time at 2 pm . They put us in line in a small room and told us to stand shoulder to shoulder to fit everyone about 60 people in a small room. This is a fire and health concern. Everyone took they're lunch with 60 people waiting in the little waiting room. Management needs training on staff scheduling so the office can provide quality service and work efficiently. I have not got paid in more than a month and all they tell me is that it will be processed soon. When this same situation happened in October and my payments were delayed one young lady ensured to assist me and proceeded my payments. Only time this office was useful. Security telling everyone to ""move forward there's a lot of space "" has obviously not had fire safety training. I'm asthmatic and immunocomprimised to have atleast 12 inches of distance between the person behind me and person infront of me is a right . Disgusting office",N
I have been coming every week with no solution. I applied in sept. This is a huge hardship no one calls me or helps just keep getting told to wait,N
Had a question and when I'm gonna get my first. I arrived on site in oakland just before 10 AM. I didn't get a chance to talk to anyone at the counter until 2:35 PM.. this place is very inefficient. They need a third-party to manage their efficiency.,N
I had to request for time off at least twice to go to oEDD office and my problem still not resolved. The EDD does need to hire more staffs or at least come up with more efficient methods to help us. My claim been since 12/2023. What if I do rely on the money for my living?,N
This is a terrible feeling waiting to get paid when you have bills to pay and a family to take care of,N
The Edd is joke they send out letters to call a number nobody EVER answers the phone lines are always busy can never talk to anybody it took over two months to pay my claim no communication whatsoever then overpayed me now my ss# isn't in the system for some reason can't identify me to pay back money so I'm spending a day sitting in the Edd office trying to figure this out before they garnish my account and this isn't my fault it's ridiculous how poorly run this agency is. There are times when you need to talk to someone for help and it's never there. Also this office is really busy and there's only two windows open. You need a bigger waiting room.,N
"Today we just so happened to get a gentleman who was patient and took the time to listen and explain. He actually seemed to care.

"I filled a disability claim in Feb 2924. By the time I received my benefit payment, I started working to pay the rent. I chose to work, and my disability payments ended.   In October 2024, I told the doctor that my back hurt and asked to get a release from work form.  I used the EDD website to email EDD how to get disability benefits again. No answer for the month of November 2024.  I finally Googled EDD Disability office near me and found the office at 888 S. Figueroa Los Angeles CA.   I was told to take a disability claim form and start a new claim. I turned my claim form in on November 29, 2024. That was  two months ago. It is January 3, 2024.  It would be helpful for claimants if the EDD sent text, emails and letters to send alerts and new information and claim status.      I asked the medical office manager what I needed to do to get disability again. She said she could send EDD an email to restore my benefits.",N
"I live in Fairfield . I drove all the way to Sacramento. Take a number take a seat provide my phone number and took a phone call which I could easily done from home specially being that I have one functional hand employee on the phone told me to call the hotline, which, intern does not have enough employees to cover so the process is very difficult for disabled people to drive all the way here to take a phone call that they could easily done from home. It does not make any sense if the problem is finding people at work contract those employees out .",N

The staff in this office were extremely unorganized. At 3:45 they told us whoever was inside of the building would be helped. I was inside the building and at 4:30 they told myself and 3 other people we needed to leave because they had paperwork to do and were not able to assist us. They then went outside and collected the phone numbers of all those in line and told them they would call them back to help within 24-48 hours.,N
"The system currently set up to speak with a person is antiquated and inefficient.  If the telephone representatives answered the phones, you would have less people going to the physical location. There is ZERO accountability or audit of how well your phone system is working for the injured/disabled employee.  The online profile provides limited access and functionality. The government can do better!!",N
"The reps are always helpful. However, after physically dropping off paperwork in-person 2 months ago and getting no response, I came to the office and waited 4 hours for the reps to tell me my paperwork was lost . . . I had printed 1.5 years of paystubs from 3 employers, an Excel spreadsheet with 1.5 years worth of hours worked and a 2 page statement lost and have been waiting for issues to resolve since my last payment April 11, 2024. This was so heartbreaking!! A manager apologized and asked me to fax some of the documents. I'm back at the office waiting hours 1-2 weeks later praying my paperwork was not lost again. Meanwhile, I'm facing eviction, had to pull my kids out of their Christian school last month, my car is in repossession, can barely buy food, don't qualify for any other services and have had multiple delays in medical care, so my condition has worsened and yet no one can help me. Please, there has to be an easier way than this. Muingo Muthui, DI-1011-443-121",N
Your website is impossible to use and your phone center is always understaffed. You call and your unable to talk to someone because the number of people on hold has exceeded your limits. Your suppose to here to help us out and you're more of a burden than help. I guess that's what I should expect from our civil service...,N
"Please assist the current system is not working for your employees or me, the disabled. It took over 6days with over 100 calls per day to reach a rep. Invalid info given once I had my in person visit. I have yet to receive my over due payment. My home water may be terminated today. My bills are not being paid on time and late fees are applicable. We need better communication. Please help! ASAP! Please release my funds today! I'm hungry without food! I'm unable to continue to borrow from others. This is humiliating!! Natia Carter",N
"Impossible to get help over the phone, website and even visiting the center ( I have visited 6 times in last 4 weeks). Never spoken to a rep in person. Always to go center so I can get a phone call. Couple of occasions been #620 and above to get a phone call.",N
I appreciate the help I got. After I dropped off paperwork I was called immediately to let me know I had made an error. I was able to return to the office and clear up the mistake right away allowing to avoid additional delays. I appreciate the attention to detail shown today.,P
"A pitiful, shame that in order to have any forward momentum on my case I have to come to your unmarked building and wait more than two hours to speak with some disrespectful worker who in my opinion, had a problem with me because I was black based on the fact that he was friendly and courteous to every Spanish-speaking individual that saw him before me, and yet as I am Asking questions he could not even contain his disdain for me and was quite rude. Responding to me as I had to dig out every single step needed to be done in order to get my case moving forward. It would be a whole lot easier if you're online resource had more clear , step-by-step instruction on how to update my case and receive a realistic set of instructions to resolve small issues. I do not like coming into this office, especially when the only friendly people I speak with are the security guards. You could also stand to increase your call center staff to avoid not ever being able to reach a live person",N
"It was embarrassing to know that the office has only 2 workers at the desk to help all 1000"""""" people who show up for important issues.  Thankyou for hearing me out",N
"It's very overwhelming that we as civil citizens have to wait 4 hours plus to be seeing by a representative when the matter that need to be addressed could be answered with a quick call it's very difficult sometimes to take time off from work or either drive to show to the offices for a. Update on the Claim. Another thing I would like to mention is the way that the security officers treat us, there is no respect we are directed to wait in a very rude manner .",N
It said my claim would take 2 weeks to approve. It's now been more than 2 weeks. I've now spent more than 3 hours just waiting to speak with someone. These are benefits that I HAVE PAID INTO. I'm recovering from surgery and have bills to pay. It should not be THIS DIFFICULT!,N
"Make it easier to call or get a call back from someone that can actually help me. Inwas told to stay in the office or in the building and I would get a call back from the edd main office. The person that called me back spoke to me in Spanish when I have never indicated anything in Spanish. Then all he could do was take a message from me and have office staff review it. There was an issue with my claim a few months ago and it was cleared up. Well, or so I thought. I keep getting messed up when i have to do a continued claim certification. Yet I can't get it done by phone because you can't get through ( I've called over 300 times in one day to to avail) canyon get it done at the office and they won't mail the form. Plus when I've sent an email through the online portal and not gotten a response. It's like it's a runaround and you want people to just give up. Cmon. Let's do better.",N
"The process seems redundant. You get a number, wait to sign in, then wait to go to another room to wait. I do understand the space but it just seems like there can be another way. More convenient for the consumer and workers",N
"I had to wait 20+ minutes standing to get a number. People with disabilities impacting their ability to stand were negatively impacted. Once I got a number I had to wait a total of 2 hours to see one of two representatives in a terribly understaffed office to get a form which reasonably should be available for download on the  EDD website or set out on a wall or counter. The two representatives helping customers went intervals of 10-15+ minutes without helping a new customer. Please utilize your electronic resources and make forms available for your customers to download, online.",N
"We drove down to the office and was told everything was taken care of, but before we even got home we got a call asking questions while we were on the road. Why weren't the questions posed while we there? Then the person said they just needed to know if we were helped. Yes, up to the point we got the phone call, then we turned around to head back to the office. Then we got a call from a manager who said everything was fine. Someone needs to train the person who made that first call.",N
"This is my 3rd visit to this office. My benefits abruptly stopped without any form being sent via mail or online. I came to the office and completed the form twice. The first time after submitting the form I was told it was on someone's desk. The second time the supervisor told me it would be done right away. Before today, Tatiana was extremely rude, dismissive and told me that I was just paid on 8/22 I should be able to pay my rent. The front desk worker today and the lady that I spoke to on the phone was very helpful and I felt heard. In a nutshell, my benefits stopped without warning the forms that they requested were never sent to me. I completed it twice in two weeks and still haven't been paid. I shared my hardships with the supervisor 9/14. Hopefully, this time I will receive my benefits today as promised.",N
Security team is not well inform on things,N
I was unable to utilize SDI online because my first name had more text characters required and the online form insufficient numbers of characters invalidated my claim since it doesnt match my name accurately. Please add more characters onto name fields.,N
"Tickets should be given as people are in order seated prior to getting a ticket once sent upstairs, keeping waiting order fair unlike now. Individuals who are just being seated are being seen prior to people who have been waiting longer. Worker was very helpful with issue. Current set up allows everyone in room to hear your personal situation. Online accounts should allow registration for individuals with longer names. Phone system for SDI is complete trash, not one time able to speak to a representative.",N
Long lines and waiting 30mins with no one working due to all 3 workers on break and us breathing each other's air. People getting in front just because they said that they were here earlier which l did as well but was told that l had to male line again. Please find a solution to make everyone happy specially me that l have severe asthma and unable to get thru your phone lines and that's why l came in person.,N
I feel Rachael supervisor can have more patience when on the phone I waited hours and visited this place 3 times in 1 week and she gets flustered because she wants too explain everything in 5 minutes and hang up. The girl in the front is very nice and has great customer service. San Bernardino office,O

Until now my file hasn't been processed yet.i called phone number EDD wensite provided.no one answers so far. I tried several different agencies to  assist my problem.but unable to get  help. This is my 2nd time visit this office and filled paper to submit to Supervisor. Please help me. I haven't got paid last 8 weeks. My EDD filing receipt number is #R100000182453690.

Is it absurd that new mothers with breasfed infants have to wait over 1 hour in a lobby full of strangers while breastfeeding their baby just to get an update on the benefits they paid into. Will not reconmend to anyone.,N
Not enough staff to help claimants  Staff over worked Waiting period is way too long Privacy is not warranted  Staff and security very rude,N
"You need to hire more agents and maybe offer help in Spanish. It's ridiculous that there is not someone available that speaks Spanish but even more that they prevented someone from trying to help someone translate. This entire office is a mess and needs better management. If your agents would answer online messages half of the people that come in wouldn't need to. Do better, you are an embarrassment considering this is a state institution.",N
Your systems need redesigning. It is not clear to the citizens what it is they should do. I would recommend you working with a consulting firm like Accenture to help with the redesign of the application process and your online instructions. Or you could place this all into ChatGPT and use that to help you redesign your application processes.,O
"It was a long process to speak to a representative but The representative who assisted me was nice and courteous unlike the office manager who was loud RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL to clients and her staff. The Manager was arguing with an older lady in the lobby, so loud I could not focus nor hear the representative who Was assisting me through the thick glass, it was UNACCEPTABLE behaviorâ¦.. I honestly hope this Manager gets some disciplinary action, she should not be treating people like that.  I wish I never get to go back to this office again!!!! Visit 1/15/25",N
"I strongly recommend that the Paid Family Care Leave department consider expanding its resources, whether through additional offices or more staff to handle phone inquiries. Since opening my application, I have been unable to reach anyone through the 877 number. Regardless of the day or time, the automated system consistently informs me that the maximum number of callers has been reached, directing me to try again later.    It was only by chance that I discovered visiting an EDD office in person is the most reliable way to speak with someone. Unfortunately, this required me to take time off work to travel to Van Nuys, causing me to lose income in addition to the delayed payments due to the reliance on traditional mail for communication.    This process has been both frustrating and costly, and I hope improvements can be made to better support those relying on these critical benefits.",N
Hire or have more representatives able to assist (back up help when needed) especially during peak hours.  The wait time to ask or get quick help is ridiculous.,N
Cannot reach anyone through the phone system. Please do not drop the call because of call volume,O
"I feel the office protocol can be changed. The wait times are much for disabled people, as well as representatives can be more courteous & sympathetic to customers. Papers turned in are some times lost . More work ethic & efficiency are needed at times.",O
Jennifer C was very helpful. Has answered all my questions and helped me with my paper application.,P
The employees here are great! Everyone here is very helpful and very patient with everyone. The only thing that is needed here in my opinion is a speaker outside that announces the numbers. That would help out a lot. I think that would keep people from blocking the door. Besides that Ty guys for all your hard work.,P
I've come in 3 times for the same issue. I've been told it would be taken care of each time and I'd receive follow up correspondence   Nothing has been done.,O
I need a Special document!!!,O
"I would like to give 4 people a compliment all 4 people were professional, kind, and proficient. They listened and did their job very well.  1. David  2. Carla  3. Rito  4. Juan  Please give these people credit.",P
It is absolutely absurd that there is no way to make an appointment like DMV so you are not having to literally spend all day waiting just to get a form to fill out. Also how about having forms available for pick up!  And maybe have more than 4 windows to help people. Obviously there is a need for more. And it would be nice if the employees you do have not be rude. This state needs to do better.,N
Only have three windows available and actually only have two staff working. I showed up at 7:30am to the office and not until 11:30amish to get my SDI issue resolved. Hopefully EDD can have more staff and windows to assist people who's in need of help.,O
Celeste was so very helpful! She called me back twice and went above and beyond,P
I was told there is a 30 minute wait and it's been more than 3 hours to be seen. Please hire more people to answer the phone and help in person.  Plus can you create a way for us to fax or email documents.,N
You need a better system. When calling in to SDI you can never get a representative. Online never gives you answer or updates.The only way you can get any help is to go all the way to the office and wait for hours til your number is called,N
"I have been to this office four times for updates on my claim for PFL, all  the clerks were rude or did not know the appropriate procedure for PFL. On my fourth attempt Luz was very kind to explain to me what was goanna happend and I hope this time I get that call back ! Thank you for your patience and kindness Luz !",P
"This facility needs more bilingual employees with a secondary language in Spanish. Majority of the over head are Hispanics which most of the time need interpretation either by security, or good samaritans going out their way. Every visit I come to is the same scenario each time. Which is why the lines take a lot longer to move. I respect the Hispanic security here for always going above and beyond to help anyone in here in anyway he can. He brings a great presentation of customer service.",P
"They take to long with costumers,, I checked the time, they take like 20 minutes with customer, they take to long",N
There needs to be a Better system. There were 3 windows with only one worker helping people with their questions and concerns. I was in the office waiting for 6 hours before someone could help.,N
SURG who Helped me was  Very Nice and Very Helpful!!! ððððððððð,P
Thank you. Can improve.,P
The can help more employees  Tha can survey team,O
It would be helpful to know what number they are serving in the disability area since it is busy and hard to tell where you are in the que,O
Agents very slow and only one windows out of 3 nobody speaking other languages ro help workers,N
Need help on new application for spouse,O
Team was organized and helpful,P
I was helped by Briana R. and she was amazing! She was profesional and efficient and answered all of my questions and fixed a problem that I had. Great service,P
My name is Felicia Shyne. I came in today to the Chino office and everybody was really nice and polite and understanding I like coming into the office better than being on the phone or trying to login because sometimes it's very difficult so thank you for having this office for us.,P
"It would be nice if the office returned to how it used to be, we'd come in get a number and take a seat vs having to stand in line for 40+ min to c speak with someone at the window. Or it would be nice to have 3 clerks for those general questions. Thank you!",O
"I'm in desability, 8 weeks ago and, need my money, I don't know what happened, you guys need be more fast about the claims, thanks",N
I received good information from Veve a customer service representative who is sending me forms via USPS mail concerning my submitted application,P
Sac employees are nicer than Oakland,P
I got the best helped from Mr Alparan and he generously guided me with all the becessary steps that I need to do. He gave me what I called TCS for total customer satisfaction. I also wanred to give credit to his immediate supervisor for training him. Customers are benefited in all aspects and thamk you for your services. God bless EDD.,P
Have more representatives to help,P
"I am to the office I left my phone number ,they supposed to call and is been one weeck and I'm here again waiting,I yes need a letter Exhainstion",N
I have been to the Sacramento office 3 times. I could not get ahold on the phone even if I tried multiple times. In person was very easy. There was a wait but the staff is very patient and nice. G-2 the security guy at the door should be recognized as an excellent employee.  He engaged with all the people who arrived. He was very nice and friendly.  Please let all the staff know at Sa on broadway they are doing a good job and we appreciate their patience.,P
The office is very small and they is an issue with security by providing your personal information on a piece of paper and then putting it in a window where other people could have access to. It is very easy to see someone else's information and it should be fixed immediately. Please provide a more secure way to provide personal information to worker.,N
"Other than the wait times being egregious, was very pleased with the assistance I received today. Definitely needs to be st least 2 more windows available during busy times. BRIAN WAS AWESOME! Kind, patient, helpful, knowledgeable. Really enjoyed working with him and he was able to answer all of my questions and make progress on what I needed.   EDD phone systems are awful - always busy, never get an answer. Would use more if it actually was effective to avoid going in person, but in person seems to be the only way to actually get ahold of anyone and to resolve issues effectively.",P
"This office in Sherman Way, Van Ness is impeccable, extremely efficient and useful. This is my second time coming here. Great customer service and support. Congratulations.",P
"Brian from the Santa Barbara Disability Insurance office was very kind, knowledgeable, and helpful. He helped me through all of my questions and was able to start the process to resolve my issue.",P
I think your office would be a lot more efficient if you didn't just have 2 windows open and the majority of people that were here were bilingual and the people at the window made it a lot harder for the Hispanics to understand. If you had more windows with Spanish speaking help this office would move a lot more efficiently and fast,O
Very helpful representative over the phone she also made sure to put notes down so that they expedite my claim,P
I feel like everyone should be a little more nicer,O
The service agent was MOST HELPFUL AND VERY PATIENT,P
"Angela was great, very personable and helped me understand what was wrong with my claim she even took it upon herself to fix it right front of me with a positive attitude",P
The Security was Very Informational she is very out going an bring the vibes the need to be brought to enjoy your experience here At the EDD office,P
"Yes more agents need to be available to answer phone calls, and more personal when you visit in person, the way is set up is too slow and csn be improved by simply horinv mord agents.",N
Will from the EDD office who Processed my claim was very customer focused and helped me navigate the unknown   The fellow behind d tbe plexiglass was very helpful too,P
Live phone help would be appreciated.,O
Charles was very helpful and very nice when we came to the visit in San Bernardino,P
"Wayne was amazing, professional and helpful.",P
I had to come to this office 3 times and finally the fourth time Brianna R. In this office explained everything so clearly and well and I understood the whole situation my case was in. She was nice courteous friendly and very polite.,P
I hope you guys will help me because I lost my vision and can't not see clearly I'm waiting for my doctor to have surgery I don't have any money to pay my bills me rent please help me I don't want to be homeless because I don't have money to pay rent,N
